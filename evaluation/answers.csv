Here are a few of them:

1. Streamline Design: Art Deco often uses streamlined, geometric forms and this can be seen in the bridge through the lean lines and sweeping cables that bind the structure together. 

2. Structural Symmetry: Symmetry is a staple of the Art Deco style. The Golden Gate Bridge shows this in its repeated use of vertical suspension stakes that hold the main cables in place, as well as in its dual towers that mirror each other on either side of the bridge.

4. Decorative Elements: Although the bridge is mostly functional in design, there are elements which contain no functionality but exist for purely aesthetic value, another characteristic of Art Deco.
