                "answer": "The Golden Gate Bridge, an iconic landmark of San Francisco, is often regarded as an elegy to the Art Deco design movement of the early 20th century. While the bridge's primary purpose was functional, several Art Deco elements were incorporated into its design:\n\n1. Symmetry: The Art Deco movement highly values symmetry, which the Golden Gate Bridge incorporates through its repeating patterns in its structure, such as the linear arrangement of its suspension cables and towers.\n\n2. Geometric shapes and patterns: Art Deco is also renowned for its use of geometric shapes. The vertical lines of the bridge's towers and the repeating lines of the suspending cables give a strong geometric look, a key feature of Art Deco. \n\n3. Stepped Forms: The bridge's two main towers feature stepped forms, another characteristic Art Deco design attribute. The towers rise in three distinct stages, with each stage smaller than the one beneath it.\n\n4. Streamlined and sleek design: Art Deco appreciated streamlined, sleek designs which the Golden Gate Bridge certainly offers. Despite its massive size, the use of light steel cables provides it with a certain sleekness.\n\n5. Focus on modernity and progress: The Golden Gate Bridge's very construction was a feat of modern engineering. Its bold, forward-thinking design embodies the Art Deco movement's focus on advancement and innovation.\n\n6. Decorations: The geometric details at the top of the towers, the Art Deco lighting at the base of the towers and along the bridge also reflect the Art Deco style.\n\n7. Color Choice: The bridge's distinctive \"International Orange\" paint job, often associated with the hue of sunset, can also be argued as furthering the Art Deco masterpiece's appeal, giving it a grand and glamorous appearance.",

These diagonal stripes add visual interest and create a sense of dynamic movement.\n5. **Luminous accents**: At night, the bridge's towers and suspension cables are illuminated by lights that cast an ethereal glow, evoking the glamour and sophistication often associated with Art Deco design.\n6. **Artistic ornamentation**: The bridge's piers and towers feature various artistic ornaments, including carved stone, metalwork, and painted details, which add visual interest and create a sense of elegance.\n7. **Industrial modernism**: The Golden Gate Bridge's use of industrial materials like steel, concrete, and cable suspensions reflects the intersection of Art Deco's ornate style with modernist principles.\n\nWhile the Golden Gate Bridge may not be as overtly ornate or decorative as some other Art Deco structures, its incorporation of these design elements helps to situate it within the broader context of 1930s architectural styles.",

The exterior of the building is largely clad in Indiana limestone, creating a surfaced grandeur with sleek and clean lines.\n\nThe facade is organized in a tripartite system - a three-part vertical division that mirrors classic column design, with a base, a shaft, and a capital. The base covers the lower three floors and is adorned with dynamic sculpture groups, while some are recessed beneath an extruded flat stone surround.\n\nThe shaft comprises the majority of the building's 70 stories and is mostly uniform with a series of rectangular windows which punctuates the smooth limestone finish. The windows showcase a minimalist style, beautifully complimenting the subdued opulence of the stone. \n\nThe capital is impressively crowned by a stepped back design, reflecting a \"wedding cake\" style, typical to American skyscrapers of its era due to the city zoning laws of the time. The topmost floors narrow to form a distinctive peak, making it one of New York's easily identified buildings.\n\nThe main entrance, which faces a sunken plaza, echoes the grandiosity of the building. Over it is a dramatic, recessed loggia, focusing attention on the entrance while exhibiting the allegorical relief sculpture of \"Intelligence Awakening Mankind.\"\n\nOverall, the fa\u00e7ade of 30 Rockefeller Plaza is an imposing manifestation of Art Deco elegance that impeccably melds grandiose style with sleek subtlety.",
