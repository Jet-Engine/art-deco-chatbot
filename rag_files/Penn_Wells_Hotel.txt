History and architectural features
This historic structure was built in 1829 and was expanded and renovated in the 1920s. It was damaged by fire in 1906.[1]

Once known as Coles House, "The Penn Wells Hotel sits as the centerpiece of Wellsboro, Pennsylvania's gaslit Main Street historic district."[1][2]

It is located on Pennsylvania Route 6, which at one time was the Roosevelt Highway, the main route between New York City and Chicago, bringing much business to the hotel.[1]

It is located adjacent to the Art Deco Arcadia Theatre (1921), which is owned by the same company that owns the hotel;[3] the hotel and the theater co-sponsor film festivals.[1]

Dunham's Department Store is located across the street from the hotel. The Dunham family owned the Arcadia Theatre and were instrumental in protecting the Penn Wells Hotel from "extinction."[4]

A contributing building in the Wellsboro Historic District, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
