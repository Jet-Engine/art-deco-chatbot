History
BHS was originally established in 1873, with a subsequent building in 1912, then the core of the present building in 1934–35.

The present building, designed in the Classical Moderne (or PWA Moderne) style was, at the time, the largest Public Works Administration (PWA) project in the state.[5] Designed by architect Robert A. Ritterbush of Ritterbush Brothers, the general contractor was Maurice Schumacher (Minneapolis).[5] The exterior brick with stone lintels for doorways and window frames, and aluminum spandrels for decoration. The pilasters between the window bays are fluted. Three roof elevations on the gymnasium wing, with locker rooms, stage, and gymnasium proper. The foundation is dull-rose colored Kasota limestone; Hebron faced brick in a greyish brown color; the only wood initially used in the structure were for finishing purposes and some of the floors.[5] It was constructed just north of the 1912 building, which was converted into a junior high school and demolished ahead of school's expansion in 1962-63 (also designed by Ritterbush Brothers).[6]

649 students enrolled, though only half of that was expected.[7] It remained the only high school in Bismarck until 1975 when Century High School was built.[8]
