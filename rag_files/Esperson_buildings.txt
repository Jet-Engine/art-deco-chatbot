Esperson Buildings

The Niels and Mellie Esperson Buildings are a building complex in downtown Houston, Texas. Mary Ann Azevedo of the Houston Business Journal said that they were "among the most recognizable" buildings in Downtown.[7]

The Niels Esperson Building is the only complete example of Italian Renaissance architecture in Downtown Houston.[2] Designed by theater architect John Eberson, the Esperson buildings were built in 1927 and 1941, respectively. They are elaborately detailed with massive columns, great urns, terraces, and a grand tempietto at the top, similar to one built in the courtyard of San Pietro in Rome in 1502.[2]

Mellie Esperson had the first of the two buildings constructed for her husband, Niels, a real estate and oil tycoon. His name is carved on the side of the building, above the entrance, in large letters. The name "Mellie Esperson" is carved on the accompanying structure, known as the Mellie Esperson building, although that structure is only a nineteen-story annex to the original Esperson building;[2] thus is the newer of both buildings and it is not as tall. Also, instead of it being of neo-classical design, it was constructed in Art-Deco style.

Sherry Thomas of USA Today said that rumors of the buildings being haunted existed.[8] The ghost of Mellie Esperson is said to have haunted the building.[9] In 2007 Cameron Management Inc. sold the Esperson buildings to Seligman Western Enterprises Ltd.[7]
