Santaquin Junior High School



The Santaquin Junior High School, located in Santaquin, Utah, United States, was built in 1935 as a Public Works Administration (PWA) project.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.[1]

It is a two-story brick school.  Additions during c.1950â€“60, while not compatible with its PWA Moderne original section, are on the side and rear and do not detract greatly from the architectural appearance.[2]
