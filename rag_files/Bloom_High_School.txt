Bloom High School

Bloom High School is a public school in Chicago Heights, Illinois. It is part of Bloom Township High School District 206.

The school was founded in 1900. A second Chicago Heights high school, Bloom Trail, was established in 1976 to offset overcrowding.[4] Since 1995, however, Bloom and Bloom Trail have shared the same sports programs, drawing from over 3,000 students[5][6] in grades 9 to 12.

The present Bloom High School building, erected during the Great Depression, was named to the National Register of Historic Places on June 3, 1982. It is an Art Deco structure with six WPA murals.[7]
The frescoes were created by Edgar Britton in 1935. The two limestone sculptures were designed by Curtis Drewes. The main structure of the high school was designed by the architectural firm of Royer, Danley, and Smith of Urbana, Illinois. Major additions were finished in 1956 and 1976.

In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, Bloom High School was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois).[8]

Athletics
Since 1995, Bloom and Bloom Trail have operated a cooperative athletic program.  Prior to consolidating in sports, Bloom's teams were known as the Trojans.  When combined with Bloom Trail (which used the name Blazers), teams are called the "Bloom Township Blazing Trojans".  Both alone, and as a part of the cooperative program, Bloom was a member of the South Inter-Conference Association (SICA) until the conference dissolved in 2005.  Since 2020, the program has been a member of the Southland Athletic Conference.

The following teams won their respective IHSA sponsored state championship tournament/meet.[9]

Bloom played in the title game of the Illinois High School Boys Basketball Championship in both 1974 and 1975.
