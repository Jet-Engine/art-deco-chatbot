Sullivan Tower

The Sullivan Tower was a high-rise building in Nashville, Tennessee, United States. It was built in 1940â€“1953, and demolished in 2018.

History
The Sullivan Tower was built between 1940 and 1953.[1] It was part of the headquarters of the Southern Baptist Sunday School,[2][3] later known as LifeWay Christian Resources, until November 2017, when the company moved to the Capitol View area.[4]

The building was imploded by Southwest Value Partners, a real estate development company based in San Diego, California, on July 21, 2018.[5][6] The developer is expected to develop part of the Nashville Yards where it stood.[6]

Architectural significance
The building was designed in the Art Deco architectural style.[5] In 2017, after requests from local preservationists, the Nashville Metro Historical Commission recommended its inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places,[7] to no avail.[5]
