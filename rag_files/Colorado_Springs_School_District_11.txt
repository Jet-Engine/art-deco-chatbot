History
The first school in Colorado Springs was organized by Mary Mellen "Queen" Palmer, wife of city founder William Jackson Palmer, in late 1871. Classes were first held in a home on the northeast corner of Cascade Avenue and Bijou Street, rented by Mrs. Palmer for the school.[2] School District 11 was established in August 1872.[2]: 26  The district enrollment passed 1000 by 1883[2]: 37  and stood at 1776 on opening day of the Colorado Springs High School building in 1893.[2]: 59  (That building was razed in 1938 to make way for construction of Palmer High School.)

In 1919, the school districts of Colorado City (annexed by Colorado Springs in 1917) and Colorado Springs were consolidated.[2]: 78  The district saw modest growth between 1920 and 1940, then a large boom following World War II.[2]: 80
