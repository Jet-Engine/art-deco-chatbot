History
The World Affairs Council and the school district cooperated in establishing the high school in 1981.[2]

The school's building was designed by Irwin T. Catharine and built in 1924. It is a four-story, nine bay brick building on a raised basement in the Art Deco-style. It features an entrance portico with Doric order columns supporting an entablature.[3]

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 as the Thomas Jefferson School.[1] The building and the school it previously housed were originally named for President Thomas Jefferson.
