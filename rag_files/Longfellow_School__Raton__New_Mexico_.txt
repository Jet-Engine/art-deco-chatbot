Longfellow School (Raton, New Mexico)



The Longfellow School in Raton, New Mexico, at 700 E. 4th St., is an elementary school which was built in 1939 as a Works Progress Administration project.[2]  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.[1]

It was designed by architect William C. Kruger in a modest Moderne style. It is a one-story brick building.  It was extended by additions of four classrooms to the south in the 1960s and a library to the rear, but these do not detract from its historic character.[2]
