Moscow High School

Moscow High School (MHS) is a four-year public high school in Moscow, Idaho, United States.[7] The flagship school of the Moscow School District serves grades 9–12. Since 2013, Erik Perryman has served as principal.[8][3] MHS colors are red, black, and white, and the mascot is a bear.[7]

The school district (which serves as the high school's attendance boundary) includes Moscow and Viola.[9] On the Palouse in north central Idaho, Moscow is the home of the University of Idaho.

Campus
Less than three blocks east of Main Street on a moderate slope, its current compact campus opened 85 years ago in 1939, with wings added in 1968[10][11] and 1991. The previous high school of 1912 is across Third Street to the north; it was used as the junior high until 1959 and is now the "1912 Center."[12][13] The original high school of 1892 was on the site of the present north wing; it was later Whitworth grade school and was razed in 1939.[14][15][16]

Originally a four-year high school, MHS was a senior high school (grades 10–12) for 46 years, beginning in 1966.[17] The school district reconfigured in 2012 and Moscow High returned to a four-year school in August with the addition of the freshman class.[18] A summer asbestos removal project was initiated in 2014 and extended into the school year due to delays.

An attempt to fund a new campus on the northeast edge of the city (46°44′38″N 116°58′08″W﻿ / ﻿46.744°N 116.969°W﻿ / 46.744; -116.969) was defeated by voters 19 years ago in 2005.[19][20] The levy needed a two-thirds majority to pass and was defeated with only 44% in favor.[21] Twenty seven years earlier in 1978, the state education department's supervisor of support services completed a study of the campus and recommended that the site be sold and a new high school built elsewhere.[22]

Due to its location among the oldest part of the town, the school's grounds became the location of an archeological dig orchestrated by the University of Idaho's Department of Sociology and Anthropology in the Autumn of 2019.[23]

Athletics
Moscow's athletic teams compete in IHSAA Class 4A, the second-highest in the state, in the Inland Empire League (4A).[4]
MHS competed against the largest schools in Idaho in Class A-1 (now 5A) until the fall of 1979. It was dropped a classification level in 1976,[24] but successfully appealed for three years to stay.[25] Moscow opted not to petition in 1979 and went down to  A-2 (now 3A),[26] and moved between A-2 and A-1 (Div. II)[27] until the new IHSAA classification system placed them in 4A in 2001.

Baseball
Moscow's most successful run in athletics came in baseball under longtime head coach Gary Johnson.[28][29] In an eight-season stretch from 1978 through 1985, the Bears were in seven state title games and won five, including three consecutive (1982–84).[30]

Basketball
The early MHS basketball team won four straight Idaho titles (1917–20),[31] and more recently, the girls' basketball team won three consecutive A-2 state championships (1992–94) and another in 1996 for four in five years.[32] The boys team  was an A2 state champion in 1980 finishing the season with a losing record. In the 1983–1984 season, the state of Idaho was the "test state" for the 3-point line for the entire nation for high schoolers. That season there was tremendous excitement which  attracted large crowds to the games. That same year an unusual requirement from the state was created as there were only two teams in the league at that time; Moscow and Orofino. The state required the two teams to play a "Best of 3" series. Moscow won the Best of 3 district championship after losing both league games during the season. That team then had to play a "regional championship" at a neutral site. The Bears were an A-2 state finalist in 1996 and state champion again in 1997, winning their last twenty games.[33][34]

Volleyball
The volleyball team was undefeated (29–0) in the fall of 2005 to claim their only state title.[35][36] In 1999, the boys' soccer team went 16-5-1 (.750) and won the state title, defeating Boise High 1–0 in overtime.[37]

Football
Moscow's football program was strong in Class A-1 in the late 1960s and early 1970s; the 1968 Bears were undefeated at 9–0.[38] The 1968 and 1969 teams both finished second in the state writers' polls to undefeated Borah of Boise.[39][40] Moscow went 9–1 in 1971 and was fourth in the final poll,[41] 9–0 in 1975 and again polled fourth.[42] After the move down to A-2 in 1979 and the addition of playoffs, the Bears won state titles in 1981[43] and 1992.[44][45]

Mascot
Exactly when the bear became the school mascot is not well documented, but the Lewiston Morning Tribune referred to the MHS basketball team as the "Bears" in early 1927.[46] Alumnus and head coach Lyle Smith obtained a live bear cub for a mascot in 1941.[47][48] The present school colors were noted in 1936.[49]

Facilities
Due to limited space on its 3.9-acre (1.6 ha) campus, the varsity athletic facilities are located approximately a mile (1.6 km) northeast at Bear Field (and Bear Den gym), adjacent to Moscow Middle School and the school district headquarters (46°44′20″N 116°58′55″W﻿ / ﻿46.739°N 116.982°W﻿ / 46.739; -116.982).  In 1976[50] and 1979, Moscow played its home football games across town at the Kibbie Dome on the University of Idaho campus,[51] and again in 1996, when the running track at Bear Field was being replaced.[52] Opened 58 years ago in early 1966, the Bear Den was originally known as the fieldhouse.[53][54]

State playoff and championship football games in all classifications are regularly held in the Kibbie Dome.[55]

Rivals
Moscow's oldest rivalries are with Pullman, Lewiston,[46][56] and Coeur d'Alene.[57]

A longtime member of the Inland Empire League of north Idaho, MHS currently competes with Lakeland and Sandpoint in the IEL's 4A division.  Lakeland (in Rathdrum) is about 100 miles (160 km) north of Moscow and Sandpoint is even further. (The IEL's 5A division has four teams: Lewiston, Coeur d'Alene, Lake City, and Post Falls.)
