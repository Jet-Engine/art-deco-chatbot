Stalker Hall

Stalker Hall is the current home of the College of Arts and Sciences at Indiana State University.  Originally named the Education & Social Studies Building upon completion in 1954, it was renamed Stalker Hall in 1966 in honor of Francis Marion Stalker, a long-member of the Faculty from 1892–1929.

From 2004–2005, it underwent a $5.5 million renovation which addressed structural, technological and cosmetic deficiencies.  It is now fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act standards.[1]
