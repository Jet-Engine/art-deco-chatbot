Faulkner County Courthouse

The Faulkner County Courthouse is located at 801 Locust Street in Conway, the county seat of Faulkner County, Arkansas.  It is a four-story masonry structure, built out of light-colored brick and concrete.  It has an H shape, with symmetrical wings on either side of a center section.  The center section has two-story round-arch windows, separated by pilasters, in the middle floors above the main entrance.  The fourth floor is set back from the lower floors.  Built in 1936 to a design by Wittenberg and Delony, it is an unusual combination of Colonial Revival and Art Deco architecture.[2]

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.[1]
