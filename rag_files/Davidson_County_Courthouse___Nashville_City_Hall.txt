It is an eight-story steelframe building sheathed with light beige Indiana limestone and gray-green granite as trim at entrances.  It was designed by Nashville architect Emmons H. Woolwine and Hirons and Dennison of New York, who won a design competition for the project.  It was the first building with central air conditioning in Davidson County.[2]

The building is also Nashville's City Hall and houses the offices of the Mayor of Nashville and the Nashville City Council, therein.[3]

On May 30, 2020, the building was affected by fire started by rioters.[4] Despite damage, the courthouse still reopened on June 1, 2020,[5] with at least one suspected arsonist arrested.[6]
