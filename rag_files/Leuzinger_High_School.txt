It opened on January 27, 1931, with an enrollment of 268.[2] It was named after Adolph Leuzinger in recognition of his 25 years of service on the board of trustees of the Inglewood Union High School District. The school is in the Centinela Valley Union High School District.

Faculty and administration
For many years, Leuzinger High School was considered to be a typical inner-city school, mostly known for producing athletes such as Kei Kamara, Marvcus Patton and Russell Westbrook. However, over the past few years,[when?] it has consistently shown academic growth spurts, largely due to its faculty and administration. As of 2021, the administration is headed by principal Dr. Howard Ho, and associate principals Rosalyn Varee, Jose Varela, and Dr. Karma Nicolis.[4]

Olympic mascot
As Leuzinger's first senior class graduated while the 1932 Summer Olympics were hosted in and around nearby Los Angeles, the school's nickname became the "Olympians". Leuzinger was granted authorization for the school to use the Olympic name and Olympic rings trademark. In turn, the campus of the "Olympians" also provided staging for aspects of the 1932 Olympics; facilities for the use of competitors, including a shooting range, and a bowling alley, were constructed under the main building. On September 8, 1936, construction on a women's gym with an Olympic-size swimming pool was begun. However eventual earthquake damage, combined with tougher safety codes and remodeling opportunities, required the pool's removal.[when?][citation needed]
