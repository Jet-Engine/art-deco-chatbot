United States Post Office (San Pedro, Los Angeles)

The U.S. Post Office in San Pedro, California, is a historic Streamline Moderne post office built in 1936. Designed by supervising architect Louis A. Simon with architects Gordon Kaufmann and W. Horace Austin, the San Pedro Post Office was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The building also formerly served as a U.S. Customs Office. The building's use of marble, bronze and milk glass are typical of 1930s architecture for U.S. government buildings.  The floor tile is laid in a basketweave pattern surrounded by black marble, giving the effect of rugs on a marble floor.  Some of the original bronze lamps and ink wells are still intact at the public writing desks. The Section of Painting and Sculpture commissioned Fletcher Martin to create the post office mural, titled Mail Transportation (1938).[2][3]
