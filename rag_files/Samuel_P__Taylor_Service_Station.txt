Samuel P. Taylor Service Station

The Samuel P. Taylor Service Station is a historic commercial building at 1123 West 3rd Street in Little Rock, Arkansas.  Built in 1938, it is an excellent example of a period automotive filling station with Art Deco styling.  It is a single-story L-shaped structure, with three service bays set at different angles, and an office in front.  A zigzag pattern of black tiles extends across the building's cornice, and black tile is used prominently around the main entrance and below the office windows.[2]

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.[1]
