United States Post Office–Holyoke Main

The US Post Office—Holyoke Main is a historic post office building at 650 Dwight Street in Holyoke, Massachusetts.  It opened in 1935, as a replacement for an earlier post office location at 31 Main Street, and is a distinctive local example of Art Deco architecture.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.[1]

The building is one of two post office locations serving the city, with a second in Ingleside at the Holyoke Mall.[2]

Description and history
Holyoke's main post office is located in the city's downtown, on the south side of Dwight Street between Elm and Chestnut Streets.  It is a broad two-story structure, built with a steel frame and finished in limestone with granite trim.  It has a tall central five-bay section flanked by single-story wings that are two bays wide, with entrances in the outer bays of the central section.  Each entry is topped by a transom and a panel with a carved eagle.  The main lobby is finished in marble terrazzo flooring, with marble wainscoting and plaster walls, rising to a carved cornice.  Part of the wall is painted with a mural depicting the early settlement of Holyoke.[3]

The Art Deco building, a stylistic rarity in Holyoke, was built for a total cost (including land and construction) of $284,000.  The lobby mural was executed by Ross Moffett as part of a Depression-era jobs program for artists.  The building's location was a matter of some local dispute, with competing interests remaining undecided until the Postal Service threatened to withdraw the project entirely.  The second floor interior originally held a variety of other government offices, but is now largely unused.[4]
