960 Fifth Avenue



960 Fifth Avenue, also known as 3 East 77th Street, is a luxury apartment building at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and East 77th Street in Manhattan, New York.[1] Designed by Warren & Wetmore and Rosario Candela, the 15-story structure was completed in 1928.

History
960 Fifth Avenue was built on the former site of the William A. Clark House.  When Senator Clark died in 1925, his widow and daughter, Huguette Clark, moved to 907 Fifth Avenue and sold the mansion, which cost $7 million,[2] to Anthony Campagna for $3 million (equivalent to $52,121,000 in 2023) in 1927.[3]  Campagana had the mansion torn down just 19 years after it was built in 1911.[4][5]

The new building was designed by Warren & Wetmore, who were responsible for Grand Central Terminal and the supervisory architects was Rosario Candela of Cross & Cross. Candela was "a 1920's architect known for grand flowing apartment layouts"[1] who had a habit of cloistering bedroom wings away from the grand entertaining rooms.[6] Dorothy Draper, the prominent interior decorator, was used as a consultant on the project.[7]  Campagna used Douglas L. Elliman & Co. as his broker for the sale of the coop apartments.[8]

The building was started in 1927 and completed in 1928.[9][10][11] Apartments average 14 to 17 rooms, with 8 maids' rooms, and is one of the few in New York with its own in-house restaurant.[12]  The original apartments were priced from $130,000 to $325,000 and more than 75 percent of the apartments were sold before the frame of the building was enclosed.[13]  The largest initial stockholder in the building was Dr. Preston Pope Satterwhite who reportedly paid $450,000 for his 20-room apartment,[13] which was considered the most expensive cooperative sale ever paid at the time.[7]

Reputation
According to Hall Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens, the building, along with 820 Fifth Avenue and 834 Fifth Avenue, is one of the "three top buildings, in terms of size, quality of apartments, and price" on Fifth Avenue.[14]

Dan Dorfman of The New York Sun referred to the building as "the pinnacle of New York luxury living" and stated that "some real estate experts consider it Manhattan's premier residential building."[15]
