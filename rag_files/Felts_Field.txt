Felts Field



Felts Field (IATA: SFF, ICAO: KSFF, FAA LID: SFF) is a public airport in the northwest United States, located five miles (8 km) northeast of downtown Spokane, in Spokane County, Washington. It is owned by Spokane City-County.[1]

The airport has two parallel runways. Now used for general aviation, Felts Field was Spokane's commercial airport before the opening of Spokane International Airport.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a regional reliever facility.[2]

History
Felts Field, Spokane's historic airfield, is on the south bank of the Spokane River east of Spokane. Aviation activities began in 1913. Then called the Parkwater airstrip, it was designated a municipal flying field in 1920 at the instigation of the Spokane Chamber of Commerce.

In 1926, the Department of Commerce recognized Parkwater as an airport, one of the first in the West. In September 1927, in conjunction with Spokane's National Air Races that Felts Field hosted,[3] the airport was renamed Felts Field  for James Buell Felts (1898–1927), a Washington Air National Guard aviator killed in a crash that May.[4][5] Parkwater Aviation Field, later Felts Field, was the location for flight instruction, charter service, airplane repair, aerial photography, headquarters of the 116th Observation Squadron of the Washington Air National Guard, and eventually the first airmail and commercial flights in and out of Spokane.

In the summer of 1946, the airlines (Northwest and United) moved west to Geiger Field (later Spokane International Airport). Felts Field remains a busy regional hub for private and small-plane aviation and related businesses and services. In 1991, it was designated Felts Field Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.[6][7]

Today the airport is used for general aviation. No scheduled passenger service remains at Felts, though scheduled Part 135 cargo operations remain via UPS and DHL contracting (Ameriflight LLC and previously Merlin Express Airways).
