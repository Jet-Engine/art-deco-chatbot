Fayette City Park Swimming Pool



Fayette City Park Swimming Pool, also known as the Fayette WPA Pool and WWI Memorial, is a historic swimming pool located at Fayette, Howard County, Missouri.  It was built in 1936 as a Works Progress Administration funded project.  The pool building is a roughly egg shaped, one-story Art Deco structure with a rectangular two-story entrance hall on the north. The building has two-toned brick walls and a concrete foundation.[2]: 5 [3]

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.[1]

The Fayette City Park Swimming Pool is one of several above-ground swimming pools designed by architect Wesley Bintz between 1919 and the 1950s. Headquartered in Lansing, Michigan, Bintz patented his iconic "Bintz Pool," which boasted efficiency and cost-effectiveness through the use of the "ovoid" shape and the above-ground design. While there were once about 135 "Bintz" swimming pools throughout the United States, today there are approximately 16 still standing, with even fewer still operating as swimming pools.
