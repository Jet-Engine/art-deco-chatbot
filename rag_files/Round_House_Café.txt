Round House Café



Round House Café is a café and diner in the Presidio of San Francisco, California next to the Golden Gate Bridge.

History
Built in 1938, one year after the Golden Gate Bridge was completed, Round House Café is one of the oldest restaurants in the Bay Area.[1] It is a circular Art Deco building built by American architect Alfred Finnila and overlooks the bay.[2] In 2021, a local coffee company, Equator Coffees, leased the site.[3][4][5] The diner was renovated in 2012[6] and the gift shop was then removed as a new, official gift shop has been included in the adjacent plaza renovations.[7]
