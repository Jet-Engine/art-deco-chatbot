Adams County Courthouse (North Dakota)



The Adams County Courthouse is a three-story brick courthouse building in Hettinger, North Dakota.  Built in 1928, it was designed by Ira Rush, an architect who won competitions for design of several other courthouses in the state.  The design of this one had elements of Art Deco, but appears to have been limited by budget to a more economical design.[2][3]

There was a wood-frame courthouse and a sheriff's house east of the location from 1907; this building was built in 1928 and those buildings were removed by the 1960s.  It was built by contractor Fred R. Comb.[2]: 1–2
