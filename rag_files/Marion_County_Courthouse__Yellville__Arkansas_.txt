Marion County Courthouse (Arkansas)

The Marion County Courthouse is located at Courthouse Square in Yellville, the county seat of Marion County, Arkansas.  It is a two-story stone and concrete structure, set on a raised basement.  Its main (south-facing) elevation has a series of projecting sections, with the main rectangular block of the building behind.  The first section is a Romanesque round-arched entry, flanked by square supports and topped by a small gable.  This leads through a slightly smaller gable-roofed section to a wider section, which has prominent hexagonal turrets at either side, a surviving remnant of the previous courthouse.  Most of the structure is finished in rusticated stone; there is a course of concrete at the cornice below the turrets, in which the "Marion County Courthouse" is incised.  The building was constructed in 1943â€“44, after the 1906 courthouse was heavily damaged by fire.[2] The previous courthouse was designed by George E. McDonald.[3]

The courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.[1]
