History
Cedars of Lebanon Hospital
Founded by Jewish businessman Kaspare Cohn, Cedars of Lebanon Hospital was established as the Kaspare Cohn Hospital in 1902.[16][17] At the time, Cohn donated a two-story Victorian house at 1441 Carroll Avenue in the Angeleno Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. The hospital had just 12 beds when it opened on September 21, 1902, and its services were initially free.[17] From 1906 to 1910, Dr. Sarah Vasen, the first Jewish female doctor in Los Angeles, acted as superintendent.[18] In 1910, the hospital relocated and expanded to Stephenson Avenue (now Whittier Boulevard), where it had 50 beds and a backhouse containing a 10-cot tubercular ward.[17] It gradually transformed from a charity-based hospital to a general hospital and began to charge patients.[19] In 1930, the hospital moved to 4833 Fountain Avenue, where it opened as Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, named after the religiously significant Lebanon cedars tree (Cedrus libani), which were highly sought after and used to build King Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. Cedars of Lebanon Hospital could accommodate 279 patients and was large and comprehensive, with all of the components of a modern medical facility.

Mount Sinai Hospital
Meanwhile, in 1918, the Bikur Cholim Society opened a two-room hospice, the Bikur Cholim Hospice, when the Great Influenza Pandemic hit the United States of America.[19] In 1921, the hospice relocated to an eight-bed facility in Boyle Heights and was renamed Bikur Cholim Hospital.[19] On November 7, 1926, it was renamed Mount Sinai Hospital and moved to a 50-bed facility on Bonnie Beach Place in Los Angeles.[17][19] Later, in 1950, a new Mount Sinai Hospital was built on land donated by Emma and Hyman Levine at 8700 Beverly Boulevard.[17] They had purchased 3.5 acres of land and donated the property to Mount Sinai Hospital under the auspices of their foundation.[20]

Merger of Cedars of Lebanon Hospital and Mount Sinai Hospital
Cedars of Lebanon Hospital and Mount Sinai Hospital merged in 1961 to form Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.[21][19][22] The unification of the two hospitals was made necessary by population growth and modern medical progress. A donation of $4 million by the Max Factor Family Foundation allowed the construction of the main hospital building, which broke ground on November 5, 1972, and opened on April 3, 1976.[23] The new hospital was designed jointly by Albert C. Martin & Associates and Charles Luckman Associates.[24] The main contractor was Robert E. McKee, Inc.[25] While the main hospital buildings were being built the Thalians Mental Health Center also designed by Martin and Luckman was being constructed. The main contractor was the Del E. Webb Corporation and the Thalians Center was completed in 1973.[26]

In 1994, the Cedars-Sinai Health System was established, comprising the Cedars-Sinai Medical Care Foundation, the Burns and Allen Research Institute, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.[27] The Burns and Allen Research Institute, named for George Burns and his wife, Gracie Allen, is located inside the Barbara and Marvin Davis Research Building.[28] Opened in 1996, it houses biomedical research aimed at discovering genetic, molecular and immunological factors that trigger disease.[29][30][31][32][33]

In 2006, Cedars-Sinai added the Saperstein Critical Care Tower with 150 ICU beds.[29]

In 2008[update], Cedars-Sinai served 54,947 inpatients, 350,405 outpatients, and 77,964 visits to the emergency room.[34] Cedars-Sinai received high rankings in 11 of the 16 specialties, ranking in the top 10 for digestive disorders and in the top 25 for five other specialties as listed below.[35]

In 2013, Cedars-Sinai opened its 800,000-square-foot Advanced Health Sciences Pavilion, which consists of eight stories of program space located over a six-story parking structure, on the eastern edge of its campus at the corner of San Vicente Boulevard and Gracie Allen Drive. Designed by the architectural firm Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, the pavilion brings patient care and translational research together in one site. The Advanced Health Sciences Pavilion houses the Cedars-Sinai's neurosciences programs, the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute and Regenerative Medicine Institute laboratories, as well as outpatient surgery suites, an imaging area, and an education center.[36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44]

As an international leader in biomedical research, it translates discoveries into successful treatments with global impact.[49] Cedars-Sinai investigators pair basic scientific research in areas of stem cell biology, immunology, neuroscience and genetics, with clinical and translational discoveries, to continue advancing medical breakthroughs.[49] Total research expenditure in 2020–21 was $252 million.[50] In fiscal year 2021, Cedars-Sinai received $93 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health.[51]

Some notable research areas and organized research units at Cedars-Sinai are:[52]

Cedars-Sinai Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences
The Cedars-Sinai Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (formerly known as the Cedars-Sinai's Graduate Research Education division), established in 2008, is a graduate college at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. It offers PhD and Masters programs in Biomedical Sciences and healthcare fields.[53]     There are more than 100 faculty, and over 150 enrollment; the Dean is Shlomo Melmed, MB, ChB, FRCP, MACP.[54]

The school offers programs at the Masters and Doctoral levels. Didactic lectures are conducted at the Pacific Design Center while research is conducted at the medical center, specifically at the Burns and Allen Research Institute (named for George Burns and his wife, Gracie Allen), which is located inside the Barbara and Marvin Davis Research Building on Cedars-Sinai campus.[28] Opened in 1996, it houses biomedical research aimed at discovering genetic, molecular and immunological factors that trigger disease.[29][55][31][32][33] In 2013 new research labs were created, when Cedars-Sinai opened its 800,000-square-foot Advanced Health Sciences Pavilion, which consists of eight stories of program space located over a six-story parking structure, on the eastern edge of its campus at the corner of San Vicente Boulevard and Gracie Allen Drive. Designed by the architectural firm Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, the pavilion brings patient care and translational research together in one site. The Advanced Health Sciences Pavilion houses the Cedars-Sinai's neurosciences programs, the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute and Regenerative Medicine Institute laboratories, as well as outpatient surgery suites, an imaging area, and an education center.[36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44]

Controversy
In 2008, state regulators found that Cedars-Sinai had placed the Quaid twins and others in immediate jeopardy by its improper handling of blood-thinning medication.[63]

According to articles in the Los Angeles Times in 2009, Cedars-Sinai was under investigation for significant radiation overdoses of 206 patients during CT brain perfusion scans during an 18-month period.[64][65] Since the initial investigation, it was found that GE sold several products to various medical centers with faulty radiation monitoring devices.[citation needed]

In 2011, Cedars-Sinai again created controversy by denying a liver transplant to medical marijuana patient Norman Smith. They removed Mr. Smith from a transplant waiting list for "non-compliance of our substance abuse contract",[66] despite his own oncologist at Cedars-Sinai having recommended that he use the marijuana for his pain and chemotherapy.[67] Dr. Steven D. Colquhoun, director of the Liver Transplant Program, said that the hospital "must consider issues of substance abuse seriously", but the transplant center did not seriously consider whether Mr. Smith was "using" marijuana versus "abusing" it.[68] In 2012, Cedars-Sinai denied a liver transplant to a second patient, Toni Trujillo, after her Cedars-Sinai doctors knew and approved of her legal use of medical marijuana. In both cases, the patients acceded to the hospital's demand and stopped using medical marijuana, despite its therapeutic benefits for them, but were both sent back to the bottom of the transplant list.[69][70] Smith's death inspired Americans for Safe Access to lobby for the California Medical Cannabis Organ Transplant Act (AB 258), which was enacted in July 2015 to protect future patients from dying at the hands of medical establishments prejudiced against the legal use of medical cannabis.[71]

Patient data security breaches
On June 18 through June 24, 2013, six employees were terminated for inappropriately accessing 14 patient records around the time Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's daughter was born at the hospital.[72] On June 23, 2014, an unencrypted employee laptop was stolen from an employee's home. The laptop contained patient Social Security numbers and patient health data.[73]

Art collection
First developed by philanthropists Frederick and Marcia Weisman, Cedars-Sinai's modern and contemporary art collection dates to 1976 and includes more than 4,000 original paintings, sculptures, new media installations and limited-edition prints by the likes of Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Richard Diebenkorn, Sam Francis, Claes Oldenburg, Willem de Kooning, Raymond Pettibon and Pablo Picasso. At any given time, 90 to 95 percent of the collection is on display. Nine large-scale works are located in courtyards, parking lots and public walkways throughout the approximately 30-acre campus. The collection consists entirely of gifts from donors, other institutions and occasionally the artists themselves.[74]

There is a statue of Moses in the parking lot. However the two tablets of the covenant that, according to the story, Moses received at Mount Sinai, are blank on the statue.  This led many people to ask, "why is Moses in the parking lot?"  In response, the director of community engagement, Jonathan Schreiber, has given a brief lecture explaining the history of the statues role in the hospital merger.[75]
