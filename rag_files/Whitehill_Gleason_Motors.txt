History
In December 1913, the Gulf Refining Company opened its first drive-in facility, where motorists could purchase gasoline and oil and lubricant maintenance services for their automobiles, as well as road maps. Located on Pittsburgh's Baum Boulevard in the same neighborhood where multiple automobile dealerships were located, the station also offered free air and water and became so successful that additional drive-in filling stations were opened by Gulf and other gasoline retail companies nationwide.[6]
