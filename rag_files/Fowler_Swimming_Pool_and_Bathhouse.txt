Fowler Swimming Pool and Bathhouse



The Fowler Swimming Pool and Bathhouse, located at 308 E. 6th in Fowler, Kansas, was built in 1936 by the Works Progress Administration, a New Deal work program.  It includes an oval pool and a bathhouse designed in Moderne style architecture.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.  The listing included the pool and bathhouse as contributing elements and a restroom building as a non-contributing building.[1][2]

It was deemed significant as an example of a New Deal-era program providing social and recreational resources.  It was one of 40 swimming pools facilities in Kansas that were built or improved by the Works Progress Administration.[1][2]
