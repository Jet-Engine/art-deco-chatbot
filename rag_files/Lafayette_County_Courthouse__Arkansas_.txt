Lafayette County Courthouse (Arkansas)

The Lafayette County Courthouse occupies a city block in the heart of Lewisville, Arkansas, the seat of Lafayette County.  It is a two-story brick building with Art Deco styling, built in 1940-42 as a Works Progress Administration project.  Although it has a basically rectangular plan, it has a stepped visual appearance, with single- and two-story projections.  Ornamentation of the buff brick surfaces is minimal.  It is the county's finest Art Deco structure.[2]

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.[1]
