It was designed with Art Deco detailing and ornamentation by the New York architectural firm of Voorhees, Gmelin and Walker. The company began its first conversion to dial telephone service on May 3, 1930, when 60,000 telephones in downtown Washington were switched over from the old manual system.[2]
