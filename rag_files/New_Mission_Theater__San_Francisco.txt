History
The building originally designed by the Reid Brothers. It was renovated for the Nasser Brothers Theaters circuit in 1932 by Timothy Pflueger, who transformed it into Art Deco-style.[5] It boasts a 70 foot (21Â m) marquee sign that is a local landmark. In its early life, it showed mostly "B" movies. 

In the 1960s and 1970s, it specialized in children's fare. The theater closed in 1993 and became a furniture store.[6] It was purchased by the City College of San Francisco, who proposed to raze it and build new campus facilities. But a group called "Save The New Mission Theater", headed by Alfonso Felder, lobbied to stop the college from destroying the theater.[7]

The building was renovated by the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema chain headquartered in Austin, Texas; it re-opened as a movie theater, restaurant, and bar in December 2015, and maintained the name New Mission Theater.[8]
