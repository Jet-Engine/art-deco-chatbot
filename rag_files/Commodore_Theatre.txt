Commodore Theatre

Commodore Theatre is an historic movie theater located at Portsmouth, Virginia. It was built in 1945 in the Streamline Art Deco style, and originally sat 1,000 people.[3] The theater closed in 1975 and sat empty until a change in ownership and extensive renovation beginning in 1987.[3] It reopened two years later, and as of 2023[update] was in operation displaying first-run films accompanied by a full kitchen.[4]

History
The Commodore was built in 1945 by William Stanley Wilder, a Portsmouth native who owned and operated several theaters in Virginia's Tidewater region from the 1920s through the 1940s.[3] The theater was named after Commodore James Barron, an officer on the frigate USS Chesapeake involved in the Chesapeake–Leopard affair and who is buried in a churchyard next to the theater.[3] It is rumored that the construction supplies for the building – which ordinarily would have been unavailable due to wartime shortages – were allocated to the project due to the entertainment it would provide to the large number of soldiers stationed in Portsmouth.[3]

The theater's design has been described as "an excellent example of the Streamline Art Deco style."[3] Its two-story façade features a plain mass of yellow pressed brick decorated with horizontal stripes of brown brick on the upper level with a central pavilion of curved-top vertical pylons of Indiana limestone and decorative strips of glass block.[3]  The lower level of the façade is composed of Indiana limestone ashlar veneer with a base of black marble.  A dominant element of the auditorium is the pair of restored murals on the side walls representing the progress of America and the commerce and industry of Hampton Roads.[3]

After a period of declining attendance and conversion to an adult theater, the Commodore closed in 1975.[3] It sat empty until being purchased by the current owner who performed a two-year renovation.[3] The exterior's marquee and ticket booth were retained, as were the majority of interior fixtures.[3] The original seating was removed from the main auditorium floor and replaced with dinner theater-style seating; a balcony uses traditional auditorium-style seating.[3]

The theater currently offers first-run films on a nightly basis, featuring Dolby Digital and THX sound, accompanied by a dining experience serviced by a full kitchen in the main building.[5]

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.[1]  It is located in the Downtown Portsmouth Historic District.[6]
