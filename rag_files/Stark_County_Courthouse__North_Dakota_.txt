Stark County Courthouse (North Dakota)



Stark County Courthouse is a historic courthouse in Dickinson, North Dakota, United States, which was built in 1936â€“1937. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 25, 1985.[1]

It was built for $213,000, which then represented quite a building boom, giving encouragement "to the local population that the hardest part of the Depression had ended."[2]

It, along with the Hettinger County Courthouse (in Mott) is significant for its Art Deco architecture.  The Stark County Courthouse was designed by William F. Kurke, a prolific architect.[2][3]
