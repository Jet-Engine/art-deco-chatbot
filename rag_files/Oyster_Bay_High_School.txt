History
The present high school building was completed in 1929. Though primarily used as a high school, the building was originally built to house grades K through 12. Oyster Bay's original facade is an example of Art Deco styling, and includes has some interesting details such as eagles and the letters “B” and “G”, which originally indicated separate doors for the girls and boys to enter the building. In February 1929, the children did just that, carrying their books and personal belongings from the old school building to this one.[citation needed] At the time of its opening, the new school building contained many modern features, such as classroom loudspeakers, an auditorium with a balcony and projection booth, and a central vacuuming system.

Oyster Bay phased into a 'closed-campus' model beginning in 1986, citing the district's responsibly for its students during school hours.[4]

Though it was modern in its day, the school's gym had become outdated by the 1990's; it was the oldest in Nassau County when the district replaced it in 2000 with a new, state-of-the-art gymnasium, dedicated to Howard Imhof. The 2000 additions also included a new library-media center with 18 computer stations, ushering the district's high school building into the new century.[5]
