Masonic Temple (Yuma, Arizona)

The Masonic Temple in Yuma, Arizona, was built in 1931 in the late Art Deco style of Moderne.  It was designed by Los Angelesâ€“based architects Edward Gray Taylor and Ellis Wing Taylor.[2]  In 1933, at the depth of the Great Depression, the Masonic lodge lost all its funds in a bank closure.  On November 16, 1933, the building's ownership was turned over to the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company "in satisfaction of a $16,900 realty mortgage."  It was later rented back to the Masonic chapter and on May 10, 1940, ownership was restored.[2]

It is significant as one of few major Modernist Art Deco Style buildings surviving in Yuma.[2] It was given a "substantive review" indicating historical merit in the Yuma Multiple Resource Area MPS of 1979.[3]  The Masonic Temple was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.[1]
