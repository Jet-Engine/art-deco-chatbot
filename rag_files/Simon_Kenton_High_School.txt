History
On June 19, 1935, an application was filed with the Public Works Administration for Kenton County, Kentucky for funds to construct a public high school.  The application was approved, and on November 2, 1935, a deed was signed for a 23-acre (93,000 m2) site on Madison Pike, one-half mile south of the center of the city of Independence.  A 5.5-acre (22,000 m2) addition was added shortly thereafter to allow for the construction of a lake on-site to provide water for the school.  The overall project's cost is recorded as $175,606.85.[2]

The decision to name the school after famous Kentucky pioneer Simon Kenton, was made official on October 22, 1936, with the official dedication occurring September 5 of the same year.  With an initial enrollment of 496 students, Simon Kenton High School opened its doors on September 13, 1937.[3]

The principal is Mr. Craig Reinhart.
