It has a riveted steel frame and exterior of stainless steel and porcelain enamel.  It has a long, rectangular form, 16 feet wide by 50 feet long. The interior has a plan typical of the diners of the 1940s and 1950s.  It was moved from West 49th Street and 11th Avenue, New York City, to Liberty in 2005.[2][3]

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.[1] Allan Bérubé (1946–2007) initiated the saving, redevelopment, and moving of the diner.[4]

In popular culture
The diner has served as a filming location in Kojak and American Express commercials.[5] It served as "Reggie's Diner", the local alternative to Monk's Cafe, in several episodes of Seinfeld, such as in "The Soup", when George introduces the gang to Reggie's because his attempts to date a waitress at Monk's have led to an awkward situation. In "The Bizarro Jerry" episode, the 'regular gang' of Reggie's Diner befriend Elaine and introduce her to the "alternate bizarro universe" that goes on there. In "The Pool Guy", George escapes to Reggie's when his fiancee joins the friend group at Monk's.[5]
