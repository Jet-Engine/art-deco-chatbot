Federal Office Building (Omaha, Nebraska)

The Federal Office Building (Omaha, Nebraska), also known as the Old Federal Building, is a thirteen story, stripped classical style building with Art Deco elements located in downtown Omaha, Nebraska.[2] The building was designed and built in 1933-34 by architects Thomas R. Kimball, William L. Steele, and Josiah D. Sandham as part of the firm Kimball, Steele & Sandham, plus associated architect George B. Prinz. It was built on the site of first U.S Courthouse and Post Office.

Part of the New Deal building program, the structure's original occupants were all federal agencies including the US Weather Bureau, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Agriculture, Civil Service Commission, Customs Service, Army, and Navy. The federal District Court for Nebraska met here until the late 1950s or early 1960s. The US Army Corps of Engineers was the last federal agency officed here, and subsequent to their departure in July 2008, it has not been in use by the federal government. In 1995, the building was allegedly examined as a target by Timothy McVeigh prior to his involvement in the Oklahoma City Bombing, although this fact was not substantiated by the FBI.[3]

In December 2011, the building was sold to developers who planned on turning it into a 152-room Residence Inn by Marriott. The $23Â million project was expected to be completed by 2013, and opened to guests in October 2013. In order to keep the building on the NRHP, the exterior facade remains the same, as do some of the original interior features, such as terrazzo marble floors.[3][4]
