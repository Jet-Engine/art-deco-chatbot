Palace Theatre (Jonesboro, Louisiana)



The Palace Theatre is a historic building located at 125 Jimmy Davis Boulevard in Jonesboro, Louisiana.

Built before 1924 as a brick building, it was remodelled with a stucco facade and in 1929.  The renovation included a mixture of Art Deco and Spanish Colonial Revival styling.[2][3]

It was deemed notable "as the only professional entertainment venue in Jonesboro, the seat of Jackson Parish" and "as one of the parishâ€™s very limited number of architectural landmarks."[2][3]

The theatre was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 30, 2008.[1]
