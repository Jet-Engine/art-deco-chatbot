History
The fairgrounds was created in 1905, when a volunteer organization, the Arizona Territorial Fair Association, purchased the property and first developed it.[1]  At that time, Arizona was not yet a state and had territory status.  In 1909, the grounds were purchased by the Territorial Fair Commission, which became the State Fair Commission after statehood in 1912.

WPA Administration Building
The WPA Administration Building was completed in 1939 in the PWA Moderne style.[10][11][12]  More recently it had been allowed to deteriorate, and was set for demolition in July 2014, before historic preservationists sought to stop the demolition and were granted a temporary restraining order by the Maricopa County Superior Court.[10] They were given until April 14, 2016, to raise $120,000 towards preservation of the building. They succeeded, on 8 April 2016 the project was awarded a historic preservation grant of $120,000 by the Phoenix City Council and a $80,000 grant by the Phoenix IDA, a provider of private activity bonds for projects that give a public benefit.[13]
