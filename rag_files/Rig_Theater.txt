Rig Theater



The Rig Theater is a former cinema on East Hendricks Boulevard in Wink, Texas. It was built in 1928. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.[1] It had a single screen as a cinema and had a seating capacity of 605.[2][3] At the time of the theater's construction it was the only building in Wink made from masonry other than the town's school.[4]

The Rig Theater was the childhood cinema of the young singer-songwriter Roy Orbison, where he spent many hours.[5] Orbison performed at the Rig with his early bands, the Teen Kings and the Wink Westerners. Walt Quigley, a Roy Orbison tribute artist, is raising funds to reopen the Rig Theater and to move Wink's Roy Orbison Museum into the theater's lobby.[6] Graffiti by Orbison and his friends from 1951 was found in the stairway to the balcony in 1999, and is preserved in a display at the Roy Orbison Museum.[7]

It is a two-part Early Commercial-style two-story building.[7]
