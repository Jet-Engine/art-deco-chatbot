Sumner Academy of Arts & Science



Sumner Academy of Arts and Science is a magnet school in Kansas City, Kansas and is operated by the Kansas City USD 500 school district.  Named for abolitionist Charles Sumner, it started in 1905 during a period of racial tension as a segregated school for black ("Negro") students, which offered vocational training, but emphasized college-preparatory training.  Located at 1610 N. 8th Street,[8] the current architecturally significant complex began with its Art Deco core in 1937, but has been repeatedly expanded.  The segregated Sumner High School closed in 1978, converting at that time to its present high-challenge magnet program.

History
Sumner's origins can be traced to a death in a racially charged environment.  On April 12, 1904, Roy Martin, a white student at Kansas City, Kansas High School was shot and killed at Kerr Park.  An African American named Louis Gregory was accused and arrested. The night of his arrest, a lynch mob gathered, and a group of African American citizens prevented the mob from breaking into the jail to take Gregory from custody.  Gregory was subsequently convicted of first degree murder.[9]

The morning after the shooting, all African American students were blocked from entering the high schools by white students and white citizens.  Many whites agitated for segregated schools.  For some time, white students attended classes at Kansas City Kansas High School in the morning, while black students attended in the afternoon.  In this desperate situation, some African American and white citizens eventually decided to petition the Kansas legislature to change the law prohibiting segregated high schools, requesting an allowance for a segregated high school in Kansas City, Kansas.  On February 22, 1905, the Kansas Legislature passed such a bill, which was reluctantly signed by the governor.[citation needed]

In 1905 Sumner high school opened, the first de jure segregated high school in the state of Kansas. Students moved from the old Kansas City High School and the old Central High School in Kansas City.[citation needed]

The original school was named Manual Training High School and built at the corner of 9th and Washington Boulevard.  After objections to that name from the black community, the name of Sumner was chosen instead to honor Charles Sumner (1811–1884), a member of the United States Senate from 1851 to 1874.  Charles Sumner had been very strong abolitionist and a leader of the Radical Republicans who had fought for the rights of the black people during Reconstruction.[citation needed]

In 1932, a small plot on northwest corner of 8th and Oakland was purchased which now houses the current Sumner Academy.  The current complex of buildings began in 1937.[citation needed]

In 1978 Sumner High School was officially closed as Sumner High School. Students were reassigned as part of court-ordered desegregation mandating busing for African-American students to new schools, and giving all district students the option of whether or not to attend the new school. It was reopened as 'Sumner Academy of Arts and Sciences', a magnet school for highly motivated and academically talented students.[citation needed]

In 2003, Sumner won a prestigious national award – Sumner Academy received the U.S. Dept of Education's NCLB – Blue Ribbon Schools Award for its scores on the Kansas state assessments, making it just one of four schools in Kansas to earn the distinction. In 2004, Sumner received a "Great IDEAS" grant (funded/sponsored by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Fund) for the 2004–05 school year, which encourages teachers in SLC (Small Learning Communities) to work together to develop innovative programs and projects to improve student learning. In the summer of 2005 (July 20–24), Sumner High School, later Sumner Academy of Arts & Science, celebrated its 100th anniversary since students first walked through the doors at 9th and Washington Boulevard.

Academics
Sumner Academy maintains high behavioral and academic standards for its students. Students must receive a letter of acceptance before enrolling at Sumner Academy and once enrolled are required to maintain GPA of 2.5 or higher to continue to attend.[citation needed]

The school was selected as a Blue Ribbon School in 1984 and 2003. The Blue Ribbon Award recognizes public and private schools which perform at high levels or have made significant academic improvements. One factor responsible for Sumner Academy's rigorous academic standing is its participation in the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program which is based on a 5.0 scale. Sumner began offering students the opportunity to participate in the IB program in 1987. The academy offers 20 different IB classes and over one-third of the faculty have received extensive IB training. Although only juniors and seniors are eligible to take IB classes, the effect of the IB program permeates the Sumner Academy curriculum at all grade levels.  Ninth and tenth graders often take pre-IB courses with the anticipation of enrolling in future IB work.[citation needed] Students have the opportunity to take International Baccalaureate coursework and exams. The IB participation rate at Sumner Academy of Arts & Science is 97 percent. The student body makeup is 41 percent male and 59 percent female, and the total minority enrollment is 79 percent. Sumner Academy of Arts & Science is 1 of 6 high schools in the Kansas City.

Architecture
Original Art Deco building
By 1937 Sumner had outgrown its previous facilities at Ninth and Washington and was using every inch of available space for classes.  That year the federal Works Progress Administration deemed Sumner eligible for a New Deal grant to construct a new building, eventually providing $378,000 for building and equipment.  The school board selected Joseph W. Radotinsky of Kansas City to be the architect, and in 1938 issued $751,000 in bonds.  The building was built 1938–1939 and dedicated in January 1940, with classes beginning January 2.[14][15]

Radotinsky's design features the Art Deco style in vogue at the time for federally sponsored public works.  The most striking element is the central streamlined entrance tower, which provides visual focus while housing the heating units, air intake chambers and associated filters.  The exterior consists of an articulated pattern of two tones of fire-clay brick accented by limestone trim.  The growing impact of European modernism can be seen in the massing of the structure; David H. Sachs and George Ehrlich particularly cite the influence of Willem Marinus Dudok, a Dutch architect best known for the Hilversum City Hall (Raadhuis, 1931). In turn, Dudok had borrowed extensively from Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie School, particularly in terms of brickwork and the massing of geometric forms.[16]

Subsequent expansion
There have been a number of expansions to the campus complex since this original elegant building was erected:[14]

The west wing
In 2010, a new wing was added to include all new technology. The addition was built over the west parking lot, and replaced the old temporary classroom units. The rooms are spacious, with carpeted floors, and can hold up to 40 student desks. The west wing also has new lockers and bathrooms and is equipped with some of the very latest in classroom technology.[citation needed]
