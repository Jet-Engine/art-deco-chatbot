Montgomery Ward Warehouse and Retail Store

Montgomery Ward Warehouse and Retail Store is a historic warehouse and retail building in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is an eight-story (plus penthouse) concrete structure and is roughly shaped like a squared-off number "4".  The front features a penthouse tower at the main entrance bay with a balcony and capped by a flagpole. The building houses over 1,200,000 square feet (110,000 m2) of floor space flooded by light from approximately 1,000 large multi-paned, steel frame windows. It was built about 1925 as a mail order and retail warehouse for Montgomery Ward on an 11 acres (4.5 ha) site adjacent to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad tracks.[2] The complex was one of nine large warehouses built by the company in the United States.[3]

From 2001 to 2002, the vacant warehouse was restored as an office building by Himmelrich Associates, Inc. for Maryland Department of the Environment, M&T Bank and other tenants.

Montgomery Ward Warehouse and Retail Store was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.[1]
