Winchester Coca-Cola Bottling Works

Winchester Coca-Cola Bottling Works is a historic Coca-Cola bottling plant located at Winchester, Virginia.  It was built in 1940–1941, and is a two-story, reinforced concrete Art Deco style factory faced with brick. The asymmetrical four-bay façade features large plate-glass shop windows on the first floor that allowed the bottling operation to be viewed by the passing public. It has a one-story rear addition built in 1960, and a two-story warehouse added in 1974.  Also on the property is a contributing one-story, brick storage building with a garage facility constructed in 1941. The facility closed in 2006.[3]

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.[1]
