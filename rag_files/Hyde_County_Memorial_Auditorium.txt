Hyde County Memorial Auditorium



The Hyde County Memorial Auditorium in Highmore, South Dakota was built in 1951.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.[1]

A community effort to build the auditorium began in 1945, and a fundraising campaign soon raised $25,000.  A bond issue was found to be unnecessary, and bond proceeds were returned.[2]

It was designed by architect Ursa L. Freed in a transitional style between Art Deco architecture and Art Moderne architecture.[2]

The building hosted basketball games, concerts, theater, and other community events.  The building also hosts some municipal offices.  A memorial plaque in the lobby lists local men and women who served in any war from the American Civil War on.[2]

Its opening featured Yogi Yorgesson and the "Scandahoovians", his seven-piece band.[2]
