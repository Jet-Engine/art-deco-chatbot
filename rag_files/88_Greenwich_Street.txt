88 Greenwich Street



88 Greenwich Street, also known as the Greenwich Club Residences and previously as 19 Rector Street, is a building located on the southern side of Rector Street between Greenwich and Washington Streets in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City. Constructed in 1929â€“30, this 37-story structure was designed in the Art Deco style by Lafayette A. Goldstone and Alexander Zamshnick.[4]

An entrance to the Rector Street station of the New York City Subway was located in the basement of the building and opened in 1931.[5] However, this entrance was closed by 1941.[6]

88 Greenwich Street was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. In 2006, the building was renovated into residential condominium use.[4] In 2012, the building was severely affected by flooding from Hurricane Sandy. Approximately three million cubic feet of saltwater entered the building's basement, leading to extensive damage.[7][8] Additionally, during the flooding, water dislodged an oil tank, causing it to crack upon hitting a ceiling beam.[9]
