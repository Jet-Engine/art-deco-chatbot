Denham Springs City Hall

The Denham Springs City Hall, also known as the Old Denham Springs City Hall, is a historic building located at 115 Mattie Street in Denham Springs, Louisiana.

Built in the late 1930s by the WPA and last used in the 1980s, the building is a two-story concrete structure in Art Deco style. A complete restoration, costing some $695,000, was completed in late 2008 and rededication ceremonies held on April 17.  The building now serves as a tourism office, where maps and information are distributed to people visiting the Antique Village.[2]  The original building housed the mayor and sheriff's offices, library, and the jail.[2][3][4]

The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places listings in Louisiana on April 16, 1993.[1]
