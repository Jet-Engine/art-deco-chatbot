Buildings at 104–116 West Water St.

Buildings at 104–116 West Water St. were a set of historic commercial buildings located at Elmira in Chemung County, New York.  They included a 3-story, four-bay building (114–116 W. Water); a 3+1⁄2-story, 14-bay Second Empire style building built about 1870 (106–112 W. Water); and a 2-story, five-bay Streamline Moderne building (104 W. Water).  The building at 104 W. Water was built in 1934 as an S. S. Kresge variety store.[2]

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.[1]

Two of the buildings were deemed to be safety hazards and demolished in 2014 after failed attempts to renovate them.[3] During this demolition an adjacent building was damaged and it and the third building were subsequently demolished in 2015, opening up a half-acre parcel for potential development.[4] In 2018 construction of the 100 West Water Street project began on the site.[5]
