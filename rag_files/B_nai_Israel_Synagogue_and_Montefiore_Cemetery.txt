B'nai Israel Synagogue
The B'nai Israel Synagogue (transliterated from Hebrew as "Sons / Children of Israel") is a Reform Jewish congregation and synagogue, located at 601 Cottonwood Street, in Grand Forks. 

The congregation was chartered on August 26, 1891; founded by Eastern European Jews, including Jews fleeing pogroms in Russia and Lithuanian Jews. The first building, a wooden synagogue called the Congregation of the Children of Israel, was built in 1891 at 2nd Avenue, South & 7th Street.  

The second and current synagogue was built in 1937, designed by Grand Forks architect, Joseph Bell DeRemer, in the Art Deco style of architecture, and built by local builders Skarsbro and Thorwaldson at a cost of $14,000.

In the early 1990s, B'nai Israel joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now the Union for Reform Judaism).[2]

The synagogue has been without a permanent rabbi since 1987.

Montefiore Cemetery
Montefiore Cemetery is a Jewish cemetery located at 1450 North Columbia Road, in Grand Forks. The cemetery dates from 1888. The Montefiore Cemetery in Grand Forks is one of many institutions named in honor of Sir Moses Montefiore.[3]
