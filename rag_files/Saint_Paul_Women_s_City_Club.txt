Saint Paul Women's City Club

The St. Paul Women's City Club is a 1931 Art Deco Streamline Moderne-style Mankato limestone clubhouse in Saint Paul, Minnesota, that was designed by architect Magnus Jemne (1882-1964). The building was designed to provide a "center for organized work and for social and intellectual intercourse", and provided a dining room, assembly rooms, dressing rooms, and bedrooms for the 1000 members  of the club and their guests. The building was sold to the Minnesota Museum of Art in 1972; then the Wold architectural firm;[2] and finally in 2015, District Energy St. Paul.[3] It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[4]
