Chicago Beach Apartments

The Chicago Beach Apartments, built in 1929, are located at 5100 South Cornell Avenue in Chicago, USA.[2] Landfilling and other reconfiguration of the lakefront means that the building is not as close to a beach as it once was. Currently known as Scholars Corner Apartments, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 14, 1986.[3]
