History
Built from 1915 to 1916, the $6 million William Penn opened on March 11, 1916, in what newspapers hailed as the Grandest Hotel in the nation, its first night it hosted the annual Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce Gala and was recorded as the largest gala in city history up to that time with U.S. Secretary of State Philander Knox hosting the event.[7] The original hotel covered the western half of the block, facing Mellon Square.

Ownership history
The hotel was bought from its original owners, the Pittsburgh Hotel Company, in 1928 by the Eppley Hotel Company. Eugene Eppley financed a major expansion in 1929, filling the remaining eastern half of the block, that made the William Penn the second largest hotel in the world. The expansion brought the number of rooms to 1600[8] and included an Art Deco[9] ballroom atop the hotel conceived by noted designer Joseph Urban.[10] However Eppley lost control of the hotel during the Great Depression[11]  and the new owners brought in Statler Hotels, which managed the hotel from 1940-1951.

Eppley regained controlling interest between 1950-1954, assuming management of the hotel back from Statler on January 1, 1952.[12] The hotel's sale on June 4, 1956 from the Eppley Hotel Company to the Sheraton Corporation was part of the second largest hotel sale in United States history.[13] The hotel was renamed the Penn-Sheraton Hotel.

Sheraton sold the hotel on May 22, 1968 to Nomarl, a group of local investors, for $7.75 million[14] and the William Penn returned to its original name. With less demand for hotels in the city, Nomarl reduced the number of rooms from 1300 to 900, with the unused rooms turned to dorms for Duquesne University.[14] Nomarl, in turn, sold the hotel to Alcoa in 1971.[15]

In 1984, Alcoa brought in Westin Hotels to manage the hotel, which became the Westin William Penn,[16] following $20 million in renovations which reduced the hotel from 840 to 650 rooms within the enormous building.[15] Finally, the hotel was acquired by Omni Hotels & Resorts and was renamed Omni William Penn on January 31, 2001.
