Morris Hill Cemetery Mausoleum



The Morris Hill Cemetery Mausoleum in Boise, Idaho, was designed by Tourtellotte & Hummel and constructed in 1937. The Art Deco, reinforced concrete building includes stained glass windows at the end of each wing, and a central stained glass window is across from a single, bronze door entry. The mausoleum was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.[2]

The mausoleum is managed by Boise Parks and Recreation. It was constructed after a successful public offering of subscription sales promoted by George D. Mason of Glendale, California.[3] The mausoleum was dedicated by Frank A. Rhea in 1938.[4]
