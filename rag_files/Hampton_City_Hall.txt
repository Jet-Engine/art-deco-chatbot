Hampton City Hall

Hampton City Hall is a historic city hall located at Hampton, Virginia. It was built in 1938–1939, and is a two-story, concrete building clad in brick veneer and topped with a flat roof surrounded by a parapet in the Art Deco style.  In 1962, the building was expanded and converted for use as a Juvenile Courts and Probation Office.  The entrance façade is marked by stylized fluted columns flanking the double-leaf replacement entrance doors and glass block window. There is a stylized Art Deco motif panel surrounding the City of Hampton seal above the double-leaf doors and decorative transom.  Funding for the building's construction was provided by the Public Works Administration (PWA).[3]

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.[1]

The current City Hall is located on Lincoln Street and opened in 1976.
