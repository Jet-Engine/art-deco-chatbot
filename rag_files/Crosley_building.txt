History
The Crosley Building was built in 1929 by Samuel Hannaford & Sons for the Crosley Radio Corporation. The building was designed to portray a Crosley radio set, and included 330,000 square feet.  

Crosley used the building to broadcast from his radio tower on the roof. Transmissions from the WLW-AM radio station could be heard from Florida to New York.  

The first 7 floors were used for producing and designing cars, radios, and refrigerators. The eighth floor and tower were used for offices. The Crosley Corporation used the building until the 1940s, when it was sold to Aviation Corporation. In 1960, the factory closed down. Over the next twenty years, the building had many owners who used it as a warehouse. In 1998, the building was purchased by Hosea Project Movers. In 2006, the building was abandoned. In 2012, the building was condemned. C W Development LLC purchased the building in 2014.
