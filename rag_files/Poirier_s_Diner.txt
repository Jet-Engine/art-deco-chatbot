Poirier's Diner

West Side Diner, formerly Poirier's Diner, is a historic restaurant at 1380 Westminster Street in Providence, Rhode Island.  The diner was built in 1947 by Kullman Dining Car Company, and is a typical Art Deco streamlined stainless steel structure.  It is one of two surviving Kullman diners in the state.[2] The diner was originally located at 579-581 Atwells Avenue, an industrial area, where it operated for many years. The diner closed in 1999.[3]

In 2002 the diner was forced off its land by redevelopment activity and placed in storage at 1467 Westminster Street.[2]  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.[1]

The diner was moved to 1380 Westminster Street in 2011, and was reopened as the West Side Diner in 2013.[3][4]
