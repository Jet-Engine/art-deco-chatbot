Astor Theater (Reading, Pennsylvania)



Astor Theater was a historic movie theater located in Reading, Berks County, Pennsylvania.  It was designed by architect William Harold Lee in the Art Deco style, and built in 1928. The theater seated 2,478. It operated until 1975, then was demolished in 1998 to clear space for the Sovereign Center arena (since renamed the Santander Arena). Some architectural details, such as the ornate chandelier and gates, were salvaged from the Astor Theatre and recycled in the Sovereign Center.[2]

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, and delisted in 2000.[1]
