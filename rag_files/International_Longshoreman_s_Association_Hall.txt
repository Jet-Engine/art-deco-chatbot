The hall was built in 1949 in the Art Moderne style.  Many prominent African-American entertainers performed in its auditorium.  It became a gathering place during the Civil Rights Movement. On January 1, 1959, it became the only place in Mobile to host a speaking engagement by Martin Luther King Jr. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 27, 2011.[1]
