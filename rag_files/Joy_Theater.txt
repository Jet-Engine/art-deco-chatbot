Joy Theater

The Joy Theater, named after owner Joy Houck, is a theater and historic landmark built in 1947 on Canal Street in downtown New Orleans, Louisiana. Renovations in 2011 transformed the former movie palace into a multi-purpose theater for live music, stand-up comedy, private functions, and corporate events. The theater's iconic marquee sign was restored, as was the building's original art deco architecture.[1][2]

History
On February 7, 1947, the Joy Theater opened at a cost of $275,000, with seats for 1,250 patrons. Hailed as "New Orleans' newest and most modern film temple,"[2] the theater was equipped with a crying room, a glass-enclosed area behind the back row that enabled parents with young children to enjoy the show without disturbing the other patrons.[3][4] The Joy was built by long-time theater operators Joy Houck (the theater's namesake) and Levere Montgomery, Sr. The architect was B. W. Stevens. Lover Come Back, starring Lucille Ball, was the opening feature.[4]

In 2003, "finally succumbing to the competition from megaplexes with stadium-style seating and a dozen or more screens," the Joy Theater closed.[2]

In August 2005, the flood following Hurricane Katrina inundated the structure.[4]

The Joy reopened in December 2011.[5]
