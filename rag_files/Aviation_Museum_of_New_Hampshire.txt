Aviation Museum of New Hampshire



The  Aviation Museum of New Hampshire is a historical museum operated by the New Hampshire Aviation Historical Society, a non-profit group that preserves the history of flight in the U.S. state of New Hampshire. The organization's goal is to preserve New Hampshire aviation history through a series of dynamic and hands-on exhibits and programs, as the museum's website states. 

The museum exists alongside a runway at Manchester–Boston Regional Airport that parallels a portion of the now-defunct Manchester and Lawrence Railroad. It is housed in the 1937 terminal and control tower that was moved to the east side of the airport at 27 Navigator Road in Londonderry, New Hampshire.[1][2] The museum building was enlarged in 2011.
