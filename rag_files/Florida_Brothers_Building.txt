Florida Brothers Building

The Florida Brothers Building is a historic commercial building at 319 West Hale Street in Osceola, Arkansas. It is a single-story structure, built of cut stone, with a flat roof. Built in 1936 by Thomas P. Florida to house a real estate business, it is a good example of restrained Art Deco styling. Its main facade has a center entry flanked by plate glass windows, which are topped by stone lintels cut to give the appearance of dentil molding.  The entry has a projecting stone outline with reeding, and is topped by a decorative carving.[2]

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.[1]
