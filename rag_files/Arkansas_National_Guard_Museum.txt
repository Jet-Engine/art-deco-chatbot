It is a Spanish Revival structure, designed by the Little Rock architectural firm of Thompson, Sanders, and Ginnochio, and built in 1931, when the facility was known as Camp Pike.  Originally built as an auditorium and meeting hall,[2] it is now home to the Arkansas National Guard Museum.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.[1]
