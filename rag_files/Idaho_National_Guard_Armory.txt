Idaho National Guard Armory



The Idaho National Guard Armory in Boise, Idaho, is an unreinforced, poured concrete building designed by Tourtellotte & Hummel and constructed in three phases beginning with a 1-story section in 1931. The building includes a drill hall large enough for equestrian events and a 2-story office area completed in 1956. The facade is minimally decorated and features Art Deco elements, including a cornice of stepped concrete bands, projecting pilasters, and zigzag patterning.[2]

History
The armory replaced a wood-frame building at S 10th and W Borah St, acquired by the National Guard in 1921 in response to the National Defense Act of 1920.[3] The former building was at the site of what is now Jack's Urban Meeting Place (JUMP).[4]

In 1931 the first section of the armory was constructed by local contractor J.O. Jordan at 801 Reserve St in an area of Boise known as Krall's Third Addition.[5] The building housed Troop E, 116th Cavalry, the 116th Engineers, and Battery B of the 148th Field Artillery. The building measured 62 feet by 182 feet, a large enough space for horses, trucks, tractors, and other equipment.[6] In 1936 the second section of the armory was constructed, measuring 180 feet by 180 feet, large enough space to accommodate 1200 spectators.[7][3] The facilities were improved in 1940.[8] In 1956 the third and final component of the armory was constructed by K.H. Matthews. The section included 2-story wings for office space on either side of the main entry constructed in 1936.[9]

By 1971 the building was no longer in use as a National Guard facility, and it was renovated and occupied by the Idaho Department of Public Assistance.[10] The City of Boise later acquired the site, and it was sold to J & M Land, LLC, in 2012. It was then sold to Alpha Development in 2022, a Utah-based company, working in collaboration with Ball Ventures and duURBAN Communities.[11] The building has remained vacant since 2012.[12]
