Rockford West High School



Rockford West High School (sometimes referred to as West) was a 9 through 12 grade high school of Rockford Public School District 205 in Rockford, Illinois.  Opened in 1940 to replace Rockford High School, West opened simultaneous to Rockford East to serve the quickly expanding population.

History
By 1935, the attendance in Rockford's single high school grew too large.  The board of education decided it would be best to establish two new high schools on the East and West sides of the Rock River. In 1938, the school board approved $3 million in funding to build two new high schools to replace Rockford High School, with 45% of the budget funded by Works Progress Administration. Rockford High School was renamed as Central High School and the two new schools were opened as East High School and West High School. Rockford West, located on North Rockton Avenue on the Northwest side of the city, remained open for 48 years as a high school, it now serves as West Middle School. Rockford East, located on Charles Street, is still a functioning high school and maintains the traditions of Rockford High School.[1]

High school athletics
The West basketball team won back-to-back IHSA state championships in 1955[2] and 1956.[3] Coached by Alex Saudargas, West was the third team in the history of the IHSA to win consecutive championships and gave Rockford its fourth and fifth state championships in basketball. West made the finals seven other times, 1942–43, 1943–44, 1948–49, 1958–59, 1965–66, 1966–67, and 1972–73; however, they only placed fourth in their 1967 appearance.[4]

West had four other state championship teams while serving as a high school. The boys' golf team became state champions during 1940–41, debate won two championships, the first during the 1946–47 school year, the second in 1959–60. Finally, the 1975–76 girls' field hockey team won the last championship for West High School.[5]

Individually, the school won an additional ten state championships in boys and girls swimming, boys golf, boys tennis and boys track and field. Ronald Merriott, class of 1978, won an Olympic bronze in diving during the 1984 summer games. Prior to the Olympics, Merriott won the NCAA championship in 3-meter springboard diving while attending the University of Michigan.

Facilities
Built in 1939 as part of the Works Progress Administration project which also resulted in the construction of East, the basic
design of both buildings was by Gilbert Johnson, the exterior facade, however, was designed by Jesse Barloga in the Art Modeme style. East exterior façade, on the other hand, was designed by Willis Hubbard. East was also considered an excellent example of Art Modeme architecture, and a focal point from the community from its beginning. The gymnasium was named in honor of longtime boys basketball coach Alex Saudargas, who had a record of 435–198 while coaching West.[6][7]

In fall 1969 a football stadium was built and opened next to Auburn High School. Originally, and for many years, the stadium was called "Westburn Stadium", and was used by both West and Auburn High School, based on the fact that West had no stadium on their campus. Currently, Auburn shares the stadium (now named for their first principal, John W. Wyeth Stadium) with Jefferson High School, as Jefferson also has no home stadium on its campus. Prior to the 1969–70 school year West played their "home" football games and track & field meets at Charles Beyer Stadium located at 15th Avenue & Seminary Street from 1960 to 1968 and two games in the fall of 1969 before moving to their current facility during the fall of 1969. (Beyer Stadium was also the home of the Rockford Peaches of the AAGBL from 1943 to 1954.)

Information
Rockford Central's nickname, "Rabs", was based on the school colors; red and black, West inherited those same colors, but changed the mascot to "Warriors". Rockford East also uses red and black for their school colors and continues to use "Rabs" as the team nickname; however, based on their location, an E was added making their mascot the "E-Rabs", which stands for East-Red And Blacks.
