Drew County Courthouse

The Drew County Courthouse is located at 210 South Main Street in Monticello, Arkansas.  The 3+1⁄2-story Classical Moderne building was designed by Arkansas architect H. Ray Burks and built in 1932.  It is Drew County's fourth courthouse; the first two were wood-frame buildings dating to the 1850s, the third a brick structure built 1870–71.  It is an L-shaped building, built of limestone blocks and topped by a flat tar roof.  It consists of a central block, five bays wide, and symmetrical flanking wings a single bay in width.  The central section has a portico of six Ionic columns, which rise the full three and one half stories, and are topped by a square pediment which reads "Drew County Courthouse" flanked by the date of construction.[2]

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.[1]
