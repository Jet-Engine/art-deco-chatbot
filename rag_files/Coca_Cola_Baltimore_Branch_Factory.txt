Coca-Cola Baltimore Branch Factory

Coca-Cola Baltimore Branch Factory is a historic factory complex located at Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It was constructed from 1921 to 1948 and built principally to house Coca-Cola's syrup-making operations. The complex is spread over a 9.4-acre (38,000Â m2) site and includes a two-story brick syrup factory/sugar warehouse and an earlier two-story brick mattress factory (The Simmons Building) that Coca-Cola acquired and adapted in the 1930s.  Completed in 1948, the complex housed syrup-making operations as well as the Coca-Cola Company's chemistry department.[2]

Coca-Cola Baltimore Branch Factory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. In compliance with Maryland Law, no Coca-Cola is sold before 12pm except during the months of May-Sept where the legal time is 11am. [1]
