Newton Theater

The Newton Theater (now used as a CVS Pharmacy) is located at 3601 12th Street, Northeast, Washington, D.C., in the Brookland neighborhood. The Art Deco building was designed by John Jacob Zink and opened on July 29, 1937.[2] Zink is credited with more than 200 movie theater projects in this region.[3] The first film shown at the Newton Theater was I Met Him in Paris, starring Claudette Colbert and Robert Young.[2]

After the theater closed in the mid-1960s, the Catholic University of America purchased the building and used it until 1971. The Newton Theater resumed screening films in the late 1970s, under the ownership of the Brookland Community Corporation, but that, too, ended in 1979.[4] The theater hosted punk rock concerts throughout 1984, featuring bands like Hüsker Dü, Government Issue, Negative Approach, Void, Iron Cross, 9353, Honor Role, and Malefice.[5][6][7] The Newton Theater was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.[8]
