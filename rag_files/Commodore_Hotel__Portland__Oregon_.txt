Commodore Hotel (Portland, Oregon)



The Commodore Hotel is an Art Deco-style former hotel building in Portland, Oregon, United States. It was built in 1925 and designed by Herman Brookman.[1] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.[1]

When the building was added to the National Register, it had already ceased to be used as a hotel and was vacant.  Plans to renovate the building and convert it into apartments were approved by the Portland Development Commission that year.[3]

Gilda's Italian Restaurant opened in the building's ground floor in 2010.
