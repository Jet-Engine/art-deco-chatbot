Winona City Hall

Winona City Hall is the seat of municipal government for Winona, Minnesota, United States.  It was built with federal funding from the Public Works Administration in 1939.[2]

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 for having local significance in the themes of architecture and politics/government.[3]  It was nominated as a local example of the massive federal relief efforts of the New Deal and for its exceptional Classical Moderne architecture.[2]

The building was designed by the local firm of Boyum, Schubert and Sorensen in 1938.  It is partially faced in local travertine stone. Winona City Hall originally included a police station with police garage and jail cells, which were removed when the interior of the building was remodeled in the early 1980s.[2]
