El Cortez (Reno)



The El Cortez Hotel, at 239 W. 2nd St. in Reno, Nevada, is a historic Art Deco-style hotel that was designed by Reno architects George A. Ferris & Son and was built in 1931.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.[1][2]

It was deemed significant as a fine example of Art Deco architecture and of the work of the Ferris firm.[2] Seven stories tall,[2] it was the tallest building in Nevada until the completion of Reno's Mapes Hotel in 1947.[3] It is decorated with low-relief terra cotta work. The Trocadero Casino was located inside the El Cortez from 1941 to 1951. For many years, the El Cortez still served as a hotel.[2]

El Cortez was purchased by The Siegel Group in 2014.[4]
