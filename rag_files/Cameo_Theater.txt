Cameo Theater



The Cameo Theater was built in 1936 and is located at 1445 Washington Avenue in Miami Beach, Florida. The theater has a long history and was a major venue for punk and hardcore acts beginning in 1985, when Richard Shelter struck a deal with owner Zori Hayon to book shows there. The first show was held in July 1985 and featured Canadian punk band D.O.A.[1]

In an interview with Roger Deering, Kristy O'Brien describes the Cameo and the local scene in the 80s:

History
The Cameo began as a movie theater in 1936. In 1986, with the help of iconic Miami figure Richard Shelter, the building was transformed into a music venue, booking numerous punk acts big and small, both from the local scene and from overseas.[1][3]

Zori Hayon closed the Cameo in late 1989 for renovations and reopened it in March 1990 with a concert by the Sugarcubes.[1] Around this time, however, the theater began to host more electronic-themed music shows and eventually became a disco dance club. In 1999, it was closed again for renovations and later reopened, no longer as a music venue but newly rebranded as Cameo Nightclub.[1][4]
