Eleanor McMain Secondary School

Eleanor Laura McMain Secondary School[2] is a charter secondary school in Uptown New Orleans, Louisiana.[3][4] It is operated by the Inspire Charter Network.

History
The school was named in honor of New Orleans social activist Eleanor McMain. It opened in 1932 originally as an all-girls school.[4][5] It became a coeducational junior high school in 1952, and a coeducational secondary with a magnet program in 1974. It later became an all-magnet school.[6]

Students and Alumni refer to the schools appearance as "The Birthday Cake" because of its square shape and candle-like pillars. The school is five blocks away from the former Alcee Fortier High School, now the Lusher Charter School secondary campus.

As Hurricane Katrina was about to hit, the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority (RTA) designated McMain as a place where people could receive transportation to the Louisiana Superdome, a shelter of last resort.[7]

After Hurricane Katrina, McMain remained under the Orleans Parish School Board and later the Recovery School District.

In 2017, it was announced that McMain was going to become a charter school and retain the same name under the Inspire Charter Network starting with the 2018 school year.[8]
