New Mexico Holocaust & Intolerance Museum

The New Mexico Holocaust & Intolerance Museum in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was founded in 2001 by Holocaust survivor Werner Gellert and his wife, Frances Gellert, to educate people about the Holocaust as well as other genocides and forms of bullying that have affected people around the world.[1]

In addition to the general public, the museum provides tours for schoolchildren, and offers training for teachers and school administrators about intolerance and hate prevention, and hosts monthly discussion groups.[2]

Due to the sensitive and graphic nature of the exhibits, it has been recommended not to bring children under the age of 11 to the exhibit.[3]

Their focus is not limited to one religion, culture, geographic area, or time.

In 2008, the museum was featured in the pilot episode of the TV show Breaking Bad, where it served as a clothing store.[4] During that scene, Walter White attacks a group of bullies who are teasing his disabled son.
