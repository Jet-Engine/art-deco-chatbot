Greyhound Bus Terminal (Evansville, Indiana)



The Greyhound Bus Terminal in downtown Evansville, Indiana, also known as the Greyhound Bus Station, is a Streamline Moderne-style building from 1938.  It was built at a cost of $150,000.[3][4]  Its architects include W.S. Arrasmith who designed numerous other Greyhound depots.[5] The terminal, at the corner of Third and Sycamore streets,[2] was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.[1]

In July 2008, the long-unused bus terminal and its site had been considered in discussions about potential locations for a new arena that would replace Roberts Municipal Stadium. By December, city council approved plans to build the Ford Center in another downtown location.[6]

In December 2011, then Mayor Jonathan Weinzapfel announced plans to turn the adjacent property into Bicentennial Park to celebrate the city's upcoming bicentennial in 2012.[7]

In 2016, a restaurant named Bru Burger opened inside the old terminal.
