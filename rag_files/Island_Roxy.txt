Misty
In 1960, 20th Century Fox filmed the movie Misty on location at Chincoteague. In the same town, at the premiere of the film, in 1961, the star of the film, a Chincoteague Pony named Misty of Chincoteague marched down the aisles of the theater before the showing.[2] The town memorialized Misty by encasing her hoofprints in concrete in front of the theatre (see image).Every year, the film is screened for free at the theatre.[4]
