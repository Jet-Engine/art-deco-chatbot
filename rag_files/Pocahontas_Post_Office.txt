Pocahontas Post Office

The Old Pocahontas Post Office is located at 109 Van Bibber Street in downtown Pocahontas, Arkansas. It is a single-story square brick building with a flat roof highlighted by a concrete cornice. It was built in 1936â€“37 with funding from the Works Progress Administration, and is a local example of restrained Art Deco architecture.  Its main lobby housed a mural funded by the Section of Fine Arts, drawn by H. Louis Freund, entitled Early Days of Pocahontas.[2]

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.[1]
