Estes Park Band Shell

Estes Park Band Shell is a historic building located in Iowa Falls, Iowa, United States.  Planning and construction of the band shell were a community project that began in 1931.[2]  They engaged Iowa Falls native L.L. Klippel to design the structure, and N.F. Guernsey of Sioux City, Iowa to landscape Estes Park.  Completed later in the year, the Mission/Spanish Revival structure features two bell towers with round arch balconies that flank the proscenium arch.  There is a cement basement that houses rehearsal space.  The walls are stucco, and the structure is capped with a tiled hip roof with bracketed eaves.  Over the years the band shell has hosted concerts, dances, and a variety of entertainment activities.  Labor unions and political parties have held rallies here.  Wendell Willkie spoke here when he ran for president in 1940.[2]  The band shell was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.[1]
