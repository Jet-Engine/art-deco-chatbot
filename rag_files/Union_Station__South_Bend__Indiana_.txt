Union Station (South Bend, Indiana)

Union Station Technology Center is a former union train station in South Bend, Indiana in the United States.

History
Opened in 1929 and situated across the tracks from the Studebaker auto plant, the building served the New York Central Railroad and Grand Trunk Western Railroad. It was designed by the architectural firm Fellheimer & Wagner.[1] NYC's Detroit-Chicago "Great Steel Fleet" and GTW's Chicago-Canada trains used this station. 

When the New York Central merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968 to make the Penn Central Transportation Company, it used the station as well. The last trains departed in 1971 when newly created Amtrak moved its operations to the South Shore Line station on the city's western outskirts about 1.8 miles (2.9Â km) west of Union Station constructed by the Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad a year earlier in 1970.

The building was purchased by South Bend native and University of Notre Dame graduate Kevin M. Smith in 1979.[2]

Union Station Technology Center today is in use by Global Access Point, which renovated the facility to become a data center, housing computing equipment from outside companies. The Technology Center is a state-of-the-art hub for digital information, providing a location for small businesses, data centers, data transport and carrier operations.

The railway corridor adjacent to the station carries not only trains, but also a fiber-optic trunkline. The Union Staten Technology Center functions as a colocation centre.[3]

In November 2019, the South Bend Tribune, the city's 147-year-old daily newspaper, moved its offices into Union Station Technology Center. The Tribune previously had been located at 225 West Colfax Avenue in South Bend.
