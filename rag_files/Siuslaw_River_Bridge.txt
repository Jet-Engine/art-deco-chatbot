Siuslaw River Bridge



The Siuslaw River Bridge is a bascule bridge that spans the Siuslaw River on U.S. Route 101 in Florence, Oregon. It was designed by Conde McCullough, built by the Mercer-Fraser Company of Eureka, California, and funded by the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works (later renamed the Public Works Administration). It opened in 1936.[3]

The bridge's total length is 1,568 feet (478 m).[3] When open, the 140-foot (43 m) double-leaf bascule provides 110 feet (34 m) of horizontal clearance for boat traffic. The bascule section is flanked by two 154-foot (47 m) reinforced concrete tied arches, identical to those used in the original Alsea Bay Bridge.[3] Four Art Deco-style obelisks house mechanical equipment as well as living quarters for the bridge operator.[3] The total cost of the bridge was $527,000 (equivalent to $11.7 million in 2023[4]).

The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 5, 2005.[1]
