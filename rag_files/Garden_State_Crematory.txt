Garden State Crematory

Garden State Crematory is crematory and mausoleum located at 4101 Kennedy Boulevard[1] in North Bergen, New Jersey. The back of the building overlooks the Weehawken Cemetery and it is adjacent to the Bergen Crest Mausoleum.

History
In the 19th century, the New York and New Jersey Cremation Company performed cremations inside of Becker's Castle, a brownstoned structure on the west side of then 'Hudson Boulevard' (now Kennedy Boulevard).[2][3] In 1907, the company remodeled the building, dividing the roomspaces into thousands of niches for urns and adding a two-story wing to the south side.[4]

Hindu ceremonial expansion
When the demand for the remains of Hindu customers being housed inside the complex during the 1980s to the 1990s rose, a basement room was converted into a small Hindu chapel.[5] An altar was placed in front of a large picture of Shiva; other deities adorning the chapel included Ganesha, Hanuman, Durga and Krishna. It was completed in 1997.
