Matthews-Dillon House

The Matthews-Dillon House is a historic house at 701 Skyline Drive in North Little Rock, Arkansas.  It is a 2+1‚ÅÑ2-story brick building, with a steeply pitched gable roof in a saltbox profile.  The roof is continued over a small front porch, with flush-set chimneys to its left and a gabled projection to its right.  The house was built in 1928 by the Justin Matthews Company, to a design by company architect Frank Carmean.  The house is locally unusual for its evocation of colonial New England architectural style, executed as a brick variant of medieval English architecture.[2]

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.[1]
