Americas Tower



Americas Tower, also known as 1177 Avenue of the Americas,[4] is a 50-story, 692-foot (211 m) skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, at Sixth Avenue and 45th Street.[1] Construction began in 1989[2] and was expected to be completed in 1991.[3] This schedule was altered when construction was halted in December 1989 due to lawsuits.[1][3] In February 1991, construction resumed.[1] Swanke Hayden Connell Architects designed the tower in a mixture of the art deco and postmodern styles.[1][2][3] The facade is made of polished reddish-pink granite.[1][3] The tower was sold in 2002 for US$500 million to a group of German-American investors.[4]
