Izard County Courthouse

The Izard County Courthouse is located at Courthouse Square and Arkansas Highway 69 in Melbourne, the county seat of Izard County, Arkansas.  It is a two-story structure, built of rusticated gray limestone, with modest Art Deco styling.  The grounds include a World War I memorial featuring a marble doughboy statue erected in 1930 in front of the courthouse.[2] It was built in 1938â€“1940 by crews from the National Youth Administration.  It is the county's fourth courthouse, two of the first three having been destroyed by fire.[3]

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.[1]
