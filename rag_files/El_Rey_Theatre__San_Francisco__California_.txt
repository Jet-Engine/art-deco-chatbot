El Rey Theatre (San Francisco, California)

El Rey Theatre is a historic theater building in the Ingleside Terraces neighborhood of San Francisco, California, United States. The building is listed by the city as a San Francisco Designated Landmark since 2017.[1][3][4]

History
The Balboa Theatre (built in 1922) at 1634 Ocean Avenue had preceded the El Rey in the Ingleside Terraces neighborhood.[5]

The Art Deco–Moderne El Rey Theatre building was designed by local architect Timothy L. Pflueger.[1][6] It contains a 150 feet (46 m) tower, and the tower once contained an aircraft beacon, and neon lights.[3][7] The El Rey Theatre opened on November 14, 1931, and had 1,800-seats.[8] The opening show was The Smiling Lieutenant (1931), starring Maurice Chevalier.[9] One of the retail spaces next door to the theater was the first location of The Gap (now Gap Inc.) in 1969.[10] In April 1, 1977, the theater closed.[8][11]

In 2016, the building was sold at auction to the "Voice of the Pentacost or A Place to Meet Jesus" church, which later defaulted on their mortage.[1] Since 2021, the former theater building has been slated for redevelopment into a multi-unit housing building.[1][12]
