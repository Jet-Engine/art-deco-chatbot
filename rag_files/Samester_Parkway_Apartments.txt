Samester Parkway Apartments

Samester Parkway Apartments is a historic apartment complex located at Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The 72-unit complex consists of two symmetrical detached wings, massed as stacked chevrons of six apartment buildings each, that face each other across a central courtyard.  They are three-story, red brick, garden apartment structures. The complex was constructed in 1939 in the Art Deco style.  It is an early example of Federal Housing Administration-financed garden apartments in Baltimore and is an excellent example of the American translation of European modern architectural style.[2]
On May 28, 2004, 3 children were beheaded in the apartments. [3]

Samester Parkway Apartments was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.[1]
