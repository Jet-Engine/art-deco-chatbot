Dixie Hunt Hotel



The Dixie Hunt Hotel is a historic hotel building in Gainesville, Georgia. It was built in 1937 by Brenau University on the site of a former building donated to them by an alumna, the widow of businessman Jim Hunt.[2] The university sold the building in 1969.[2] It was designed in the Art Deco style by architect William J.J. Chase.[2] The style is rare in Georgia; this is one of relatively few Art Deco buildings in the state.[2] It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since May 16, 1985.[1]
