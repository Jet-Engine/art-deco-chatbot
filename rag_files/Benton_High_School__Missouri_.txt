Benton High School (Missouri)

Benton High School is a school in St. Joseph, Missouri, United States. The public school teaches grades 9 through 12.

History
In 1905, the St. Joseph, Missouri Board of Education charged J. A. Bell with establishing a high school in South St. Joseph. In September of that year, Benton High School opened its doors for the first time as the BOE rented a hall at the corner of King Hill and Colorado Avenues until a new building was to be completed. 
In November, students moved into those new buildings on the corner of Cumberland and Yale Streets. The school had four rooms that held grades one through 12.

In 1929, Benton became a junior-senior high school that offered courses from the 7th through the 12th grade.

In 1938, the BOE purchased a tract of land on 4th Street, overlooking the Saint Joseph, Missouri parkway system and built a new building there on March 21, 1940. The new building contained 37 classrooms, an auditorium, gymnasium, and cafeteria and was three stories high.

In 1961, a non-pillared dome gymnasium was constructed on the north side of the school and named in honor of P.B. "Pop" Springer, longtime coach and teacher at Benton. The dome collapsed from heavy snow in 1971 and was replaced.
Many additions were made after 1969, including a two-story, twelve room wing with a spacious library and rooms for the math and social studies departments as well as an athletic field which was constructed in 1974 with an asphalt track and grandstands. Three years later the field was renamed "James Sparks Memorial Field" in honor of a Benton football player who lost his life during a game on the field earlier that season.

Benton currently enrolls between 700 and 900 students annually.

Since then the theatre has produced many musicals such as The Phantom of the Opera, Disney's The Little Mermaid, Bring It On!, Disney's Tarzan, and The Wizard of Oz. Benton has participated in Starlight Theatre's Blue Star Awards and has been nominated for several categories and won their costume nomination for their 2015 production of Glitz: The Little Miss Christmas Pageant Musical. The Theatre Department held a one-act festival each year, with the shows being directed by students and allowing both students and teachers to be involved as actors in the productions, to raise money for scholarships for students involved in theatre.
