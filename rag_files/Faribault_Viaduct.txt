Faribault Viaduct



The Faribault Viaduct is a reinforced concrete highway bridge which carries Minnesota State Highway 60 over the Straight River in Faribault, Minnesota, United States.[2]

It was constructed in 1937 by the Works Progress Administration with Art Deco/Classical Revival ornamentation, one of the last major examples in the state.[3] The bridge has also been described as Moderne in style.[4]

When listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989, it was noted as a civic project linking a city divided by a river and rail corridor.[5][6]  The bridge was rebuilt in 2008-09 and the decks widened, but the original piers and the three arches over the river remain.
