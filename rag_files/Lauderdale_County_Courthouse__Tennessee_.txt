Lauderdale County Courthouse (Tennessee)



The Lauderdale County Courthouse is a PWA Moderne-style courthouse built in 1936.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[1]

The two-story-plus-basement building's most prominent feature is its "vertical stepped massing".  Its central block is 50 by 55 feet (15 m × 17 m) in plan, and 40 feet (12 m) tall.  It has wings which are each 25 by 50 feet (7.6 m × 15.2 m) in plan and 35 feet (11 m) tall.[2]

It was designed by Nashville architects Marr and Holman and was built by R. M. Condra Contractors.  It was the first Public Works Administration-funded courthouse completed in Tennessee.[2]
