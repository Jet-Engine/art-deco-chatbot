History and description
The Griffith Piano Company was founded in 1911 by Parker O. Griffith. The building was designed by local architect George Elwood Jones (1886–1952), construction started in 1927, and opened on June 1, 1928.[4] It has 14 floors and is 64.01 m (210.0 ft) tall.[6] The company erected the building as a showroom, workshop, office tower and recital auditorium.[7] Under the direction of Mrs. Parker O. Griffith, a foundation supported by the company was responsible for the direction, support, and programming at Newark Symphony Hall.[8][9]

Plans to renovate the building into apartments have been proposed but have yet to bear fruit.[10][11][12]
