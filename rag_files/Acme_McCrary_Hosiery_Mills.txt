Acme-McCrary Hosiery Mills

Acme-McCrary Hosiery Mills, also known as Acme Hosiery Mills, McCrary Hosiery Mills, and Asheboro Grocery Company, is a historic textile mill complex located at Asheboro, Randolph County, North Carolina.  The complex includes six buildings and a smokestack, erected between 1909 and 1962.  The mill buildings were designed by architect Richard C. Biberstein and the oldest section is a two-story, heavy-timber-frame mill with load bearing brick walls.  The Acme-McCrary-Sapona Recreation Center was built in 1948–1949, and is a two-story, Art Moderne style brick recreation center.[2] The buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.[1]

The buildings were owned by Acme Hosiery Mills, which was purchased by brothers-in-law D.B. McCrary and T.H. Redding in 1909. Acme-McCrary went on to become the third-largest producer of private label hosiery in the world, with factories in three locations. Its production assets were purchased by Sri Lanka–based MAS Capital in 2017, but Acme-McCrary retained the historic buildings in Asheboro, which by that point only housed its corporate offices.[3] Acme-McCrary planned to vacate the buildings following the acquisition, opening up almost 200,000 square feet of downtown real estate for commercial or residential use.[4]
