Cullen Performance Hall

Cullen Performance Hall is a concert hall located on the campus of the University of Houston in Houston, Texas.  The hall, comprising the eastern half of the E. Cullen Building, was named in honor of Ezekiel W. Cullen, a former congressman for the Republic of Texas.  The facility seats 1,544, and hosts music, opera, dance, theatrical events, and public lectures.  Opening in 1950, the facility was designed by Alfred C. Finn.

History
On March 21, 1945, the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building along with Cullen Performance Hall was announced.[1]  Construction of Cullen Performance Hall was part of a large expansion to the University of Houston's permanent buildings on campus that took place starting on May 10, 1948.  The hall originally sat 1,680, and was intended to host similar events as the Houston Music Hall which was the main music venue for the city at the time.[2]  The hall was named in honor of Ezekiel W. Cullen, a congressman for the Republic of Texas, and the grandfather of then University of Houston Regent Hugh Roy Cullen who was the principal donor to the project.

The university hired native Houston architect Alfred C. Finn to design the building.[3]  In order to give the building a classical look, Finn designed the building with long wings and regularly spaced pilasters.

The dedication of the Cullen Performance Hall was held in conjunction with the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building on Halloween of 1950.[4]  For the dedication, conductor Efrem Kurtz directed the Houston Symphony Orchestra, and H.R. Cullen gave a speech.

In 1988, the facility received complete renovations.[5]
