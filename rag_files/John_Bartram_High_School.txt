John Bartram High School

John Bartram High School is a public secondary school serving neighborhoods of the Southwest Philadelphia area of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The school, which serves grades 9 through 12, is a part of the School District of Philadelphia.

History
On February 5, 1939, John Bartram High School, located at the intersection of 67th Street and Elmwood Avenue in Southwest Philadelphia, opened for the first time to 1,700 students. The school was named after Philadelphian botanist John Bartram. It was built to relieve overcrowding at West Philadelphia High School due to population increases in the southwest part of the city. According to a history of the school published on its 50th anniversary, the school was originally planned to be built at 74th Street and Dicks Avenue, but the site was changed before construction started. 

It was one of the first Philadelphia high schools named for a prominent individual rather than a geographic region of the city.

On December 4, 1986, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The school is home to PA-20032 Unit of the Air Force JROTC.[3]
