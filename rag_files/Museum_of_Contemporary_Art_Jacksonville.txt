Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville

The Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville, also known as MOCA Jacksonville, is a contemporary art museum in Jacksonville, Florida, funded and operated as a "cultural institute" of the University of North Florida. One of the largest contemporary art institutions in the Southeastern United States, it presents exhibitions by international, national and regional artists.

History
MOCA Jacksonville was founded in 1924 as the Jacksonville Fine Arts Society,[2] the first organization in the Jacksonville community devoted to the visual arts. In 1948 the museum was incorporated as the Jacksonville Art Museum, and in 1978 it became the first institution in Jacksonville to be accredited by the American Alliance of Museums.

In late 1999 the museum acquired its permanent home, the historic Western Union Telegraph Building on Hemming Plaza (now James Weldon Johnson Park), built by The Auchter Company, adjacent to the newly renovated City Hall, and became the Jacksonville Museum of Modern Art (JMOMA). In 2000, a series of preview exhibitions opened in a temporary exhibition space while the building facade was restored to its original Art Deco style. The interior was completely refurbished to house the museum's galleries, educational facilities, a theater/auditorium, Museum Shop and Café Nola. Total renovation of the 60,000-square-foot (5,600 m2), six-floor facility was completed in 2003, culminating in a grand re-opening in May of that year.[3]

Growth
After moving to its downtown location the museum experienced rapid growth in both membership and the size of the permanent collection. The many substantial additions to the collection increased not only its quality, but also its size to almost 800 pieces. In November 2006, JMOMA became the Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville.[4]

The museum continues to be a cornerstone of Jacksonville's multibillion-dollar downtown revitalization plan.[5] Its exhibitions and programming bring new visitors to the civic core during the day, at night and on weekends. Educational programming includes children's literacy initiatives and weekend art making classes as well as regular tours, lectures, films and publications for children and adults.

MOCA Jacksonville's changing exhibitions feature the works of contemporary artists working in a wide assortment of media from painting, sculpture, and video. The third floor hosts exhibitions, which rotate approximately every four months.

The University of North Florida acquired the museum in 2009 to act as a cultural resource of the university.[6]
