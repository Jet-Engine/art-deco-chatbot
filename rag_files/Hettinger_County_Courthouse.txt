Hettinger County Courthouse



The Hettinger County Courthouse in Mott, North Dakota was built in 1934. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.[1]

Its construction, during 1934â€“36, was barely allowed by passage of a bond issue to take advantage of a Public Works Administration grant.[citation needed]

It is significant for its Art Deco architecture, along with that of the Stark County Courthouse.[2][3]
