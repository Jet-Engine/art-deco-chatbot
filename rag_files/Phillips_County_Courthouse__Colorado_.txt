The Phillips County Courthouse, home of the Phillips Combined Court,[2] located at 221 Interocean Ave. in Holyoke, Colorado was built in 1935 in Moderne style.  It is significant for association with New Deal programs; the Public Works Administration built it, and it is the only surviving PWA project in the county.[3]

It was designed by Denver architect Eugene G. Groves (1882-1967).

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.[1]
