Newark Metropolitan Airport Buildings



The Newark Metropolitan Airport Buildings are at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey. Newark Metropolitan, opened in 1928, was the first major airport in the United States. The trio of Art Deco buildings, the Administration Building, Brewster Hangar and the Medical Building, were built in 1934 and dedicated by Amelia Earhart in 1935.[3] They were added to state and federal registers of historic places in 1980. In 2001, the Administration Building was relocated when a runway was lengthened,[4] and they have subsequently been renovated.[3][5] The terminal was once adorned with murals by Arshile Gorky,[6] only two of which survive and are part of the Newark Museum collection.[7]
