The ABC Auto Sales and Investment Company Building, at 3509-27 Page Blvd. in St. Louis, Missouri, was built in 1927.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.[1][2]

It is a four-story building with red brick and white terra cotta cladding,[2] designed by architect David R. Harrison.[3] It was used as an auto distributorship until 1935[2] for the Hudson Motor Car Company's Essex auto line, featuring a garage bay, an open floor plan, and a freight elevator. The building was later used by a moving and storage company into the 1960s. Laying vacant from the 1980s through the 2010s, it was acquired by developer Paul McKee in 2007.[3]
