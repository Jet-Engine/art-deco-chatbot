Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company Building

The Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company Building is a historic commercial building at 116 West 6th Avenue in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  It is a single story masonry structure with distinctive Moderne styling.  Its most prominent feature is the parapet, which was Art Deco-style blue flame-shaped finials at the ends of the central raised section.  Its walls include blocks of colored and clear glass, and tile elements.  It was built in 1950, during a building boom that followed the end of World War II, and is the best local example of this type of architecture.[2]

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.[1]
