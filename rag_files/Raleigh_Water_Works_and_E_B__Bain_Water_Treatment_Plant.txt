Raleigh Water Works and E.B. Bain Water Treatment Plant

Raleigh Water Works and E.B. Bain Water Treatment Plant is a historic water works complex located at Raleigh, North Carolina. The original section was built in 1941, with additions made about 1946â€“1947, and in the 1960s.  The
complex includes the shell of the original one-story, brick pump house (1887 with 1923 alterations); the one-story, brick filter house (1887); and the Art Deco treatment plant (1939-1940) with adjacent settling basins. The main block of the treatment plant is a three-story, three-bay wide mass topped by a hipped, battened metal roof, with flanking stepped back two-story sections. Also on the property are three storage reservoirs for treated water, dating from 1887, 1940 and the 1950s.[2]

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.[1]
