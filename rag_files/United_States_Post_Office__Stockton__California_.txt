United States Post Office (Stockton, California)

The U.S. Post Office, also known as the Federal Building, is a post office and government building in Stockton, California.

The building is designed in a mixture of classical and moderne styles known as "starved classicism". The architecture firm of Bliss and Fairweather designed the building in 1931, and it was built in 1932â€“33. The building's construction was part of a federal construction program started by Herbert Hoover.

In addition to the post office, the building has housed a variety of other federal offices and is considered "a locally prominent symbol of the federal government".[2]

The U.S. Post Office was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 10, 1983.[1]
