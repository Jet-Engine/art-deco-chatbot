Long Beach Professional Building

The Long Beach Professional Building is a historic medical office building in downtown Long Beach, California added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

The eight-story Art Deco two-part vertical block building with its pink and black lobby was built in 1929. It was designed by architect William Douglas Lee.[2] It is particularly notable as the city's first large office building devoted exclusively to medicine. It is a cast-in-place concrete building.[3]

It is also credited for introducing elements commonly found in the so-called "WPA Moderne" style of the 1930s.

In 2018 the building was re-opened by owners, Global Premier Development, and now operates under the name Regency Palms as an Assisted Living and Memory Care facility run by Meridian Senior Living. 

KTGY Architecture + Planning was responsible for the historic renovation.
