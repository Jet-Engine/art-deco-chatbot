Mumford High School

Samuel C. Mumford High School is a public high school located on the near-northwest side of Detroit, Michigan. It was operated by the Detroit Public Schools,[4] and had been operated by the Education Achievement Authority of Michigan (EAA). DPS re-assumed control of Mumford High in fall 2017.[5]

History
Following war-delayed construction, Mumford High opened in September 1949; a time when large segments of Detroit's Jewish-American population had already begun an inexorable movement toward the suburban communities of Oakland County.[6] Mumford's architectural profile featured imported powder blue limestone block and exquisite Art Deco styling similar to other Detroit high schools. During much of the 1950s and early 1960s, Mumford High served a predominantly Jewish student population.

The original building was demolished during the summer of 2012.[7] A new building was constructed at the same Wyoming Avenue address and opened in August, 2012.[citation needed]

It was named after Detroit School Board member and Detroit Edison treasurer Samuel C. Mumford.[8]

When it was operated by Detroit Public Schools (DPS), communities within Mumford's attendance zone included Palmer Park, Palmer Woods and Sherwood Forest.[9]

In 2015 the United States Department of Justice charged former EAA-era principal Kenyetta "K.C." Wilbourn-Snapp with bribery and conspiracy charges. Wilbourn, who had been principal of Mumford and Denby High School,[10] agreed to plead guilty as part of a plea bargain.[11] She pleaded guilty to tax evasion and accepting a $58,000 bribe.[12]

Athletics
1959 graduate, Barry Shapiro set a city record on his way to winning the 100-yard breaststroke, at the 1959 Detroit Public School League (DPSSAL) swimming finals. In fact, Shapiro's time was superior to the existing Michigan High School Athletic Association record for the event. Barry was among the fastest breaststrokers in the state, during a period (1931–1961) when Detroit schools did not participate in MHSAA championship events; he never had the chance to swim for a state title.[13]

Another Mumford athlete, Richard Golden made the best of his opportunity to compete at the state level. During the 1963 MHSAA finals, Richard finished third in the 50-yard freestyle; to this day, Golden is Mumford's only All-State swimmer.[14]

In 1966, in his first year as Mumford's basketball[15] coach, Sam Taub led Mumford to the east side championship in the Detroit Public School league[15] before losing to Northwestern by 3 points in the city championship game.  Mumford went on to win district and regional championships in the state tournament before losing to East Detroit in the state quarterfinals. All-State center Larry Moore averaged 27 points a game to lead the Mustangs.

In 1969, Coach Taub guided the Mustangs to the PSL title; Mumford defeated Northern High 72–55 to claim the trophy. The Mustangs advanced to the state semifinals before losing to Ypsilanti.[16]
Taub was also the school's golf coach and a collegiate basketball referee.

More recently, Mumford's track and field program has been nothing less than dynastic; winning a total of six Michigan High School Athletic Association championships since 1999.
The Lady Mustangs won state titles in 2004 and 2005; while Mumford's men brought home the MHSAA crown in 1999, 2002, 03 and 04.[17][18]

In 2005, Mumford won its first DPSSAL football title; the Mustangs defeated Finney High, 26–13 to claim the championship trophy.[19]

Notable alumni
Fred Prime, 1958 graduate, was on the track team and the basketball team.  He later graduated from Wayne State University, where he was still ranked as the number two basketball scorer of all time, even though the three point score was not allowed in his time.  He also was a finalist for City Council of Detroit.
Brian Einhorn, 1958 graduate, was later the State President of the Michigan Bar.
[[Harry Newman, Jr. was named all-city in football [he ran four punts back for touchdowns in one season while at Mumford].  His father was an All-American as quarterback at Michigan thirty years earlier.
