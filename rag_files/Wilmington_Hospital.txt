ChristianaCare

ChristianaCare is a network of private, non-profit hospitals providing health care services to all of the U.S. state of Delaware and portions of seven counties bordering the state in Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey. The system includes two hospitals in Delaware, Wilmington Hospital and Christiana Hospital, and one in Maryland, ChristianaCare Union Hospital in Elkton. ChristianaCare operates the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute, the Center for Heart & Vascular Health, The Center for Women & Children's Health, and ChristianaCare HomeHealth, as well as the Eugene du Pont Preventive Medicine & Rehabilitation Center, and a wide range of outpatient and satellite services. ChristianaCare is headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware.

History
The system's history dates to 1888, when Delaware Hospital was first opened in Wilmington.  It was expanded throughout the subsequent decades.  In 1965, it merged with Memorial Hospital and Wilmington General Hospital to form Wilmington Medical Center, with each of the three facilities being known as a "division", thus Delaware Hospital became known as the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center.  Later, it was decided to close the other two hospitals and replace them with a new one, Christiana Hospital. In 1985, the Delaware Division was renamed Wilmington Hospital.

In 2014, family medicine physician Janice E. Nevin, M.D., MPH, became president and CEO of the health system.[1][2] Under Dr. Nevin, the health system focused on excellence and love and focusing on empowering coworkers to speak up about potentially problematic behavior by others in the work environment.[1] The health care system developed CareVio, a patient centered and clinician-led information technology enhanced care coordination service, that was designed to provide information and scheduling aid in 2017.[3]

Demographics
In 2007, ChristianaCare saw 457,348 outpatient visits, 55,512 admissions and 7,100 childbirths.[4] ChristianaCare provided $35.7 million in charity care in 2007.[4] With more than 10,000 employees, it is one of the largest private employers in Delaware and among the top 10 in the greater Philadelphia region.[5] In 2017 it was reported that the Health Care system was ranked as the 22nd leading hospital and the 11th on the East Coast in terms of admissions.[3]
