Schmitz Park Bridge



The Schmitz Park Bridge is a 175 ft (53 m) concrete-box bridge that spans a ravine in Seattle's Schmitz Park. Built in 1936, the structure is both listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is a designated city landmark.[3][4]

The bridge was designed by city engineer Clark Eldridge. It replaced a timber-truss span that had been erected in 1916.[5] The funds were provided by the federal Public Works Administration and by local gas-tax and highway funds. The rigid frame created by the concrete box cells made the structure 60 percent longer than any such bridge previously constructed.[6][7]

The graffiti artwork underneath the bridge has received praise in C-Monster's art blog and from a critic with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.[8]
