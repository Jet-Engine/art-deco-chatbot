Brief history
The surveying marker of the Gila and Salt River Meridan is located on Monument Hill. Ever since 1851, this has been the center point used by the state to measure the land in Arizona. The federal government recognized this point for measuring the boundary between the United States and Mexico after the Mexicanâ€“American War ended. The first survey conducted in 1867, involved the first 36 miles of Arizona. Up until 1874, this was the epicenter of all surveying in Arizona for property deeds. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 2002, reference #02001137. Monument Hill is located at 115th Ave. and Baseline Road in Avondale, Az.[1][2]

In 1860, William G. Moore a.k.a. "Billy" moved to Arizona. He established a settlement in 1880, by the Agua Fria River (Cold Water River) area. He purchased some land there and built a stage station. The station served the travelers on their way from Tucson to northern Arizona and California. Moore also established a saloon and a general store. He named the area where his establishments were located  "Coldwater, Arizona" and he served as the post master of "Coldwater" from 1901 till 1905.[3]

Around 1905, the United States Postal service moved their office from Coldwater to a site near the Avondale Ranch. The post office was renamed Avondale Post Office. The area then became officially known as Avondale instead of Coldwater. In December 1946, the City of Avondale was incorporated.[3]
