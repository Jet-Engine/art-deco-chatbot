New Granada Theater

The New Granada Theater, which is located at 2007 Centre Avenue in the Hill District neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was built between 1927 and 1928.

History and architectural features
This Art Deco theater was designed by architect Louis Arnett Stuart Bellinger, and originally was a Pythian Temple, a meeting place for the Knights of Pythias of North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia (a fraternal order and secret society). This structure served as the lodge for a group of African American construction workers known as the Knights of the Pythian. 

During the 1930s, the building was sold to Harry Hendel, who moved two blocks from his old Granada Theater to this New Granada Theater. The building was remodeled in 1937 and 1938 by Alfred M. Marks, and it then became a movie theater, as well as a place for live entertainment, music and dancing. Jazz legends Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie, and Cab Calloway performed here.[4]

It was added to the List of City of Pittsburgh historic designations on October 8, 2004,[2] the List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks in 2007,[3] and the National Register of Historic Places on December 27, 2010.[1]
