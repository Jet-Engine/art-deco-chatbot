Altoona Armory

Altoona Armory is a historic National Guard armory located at Logan Township, Blair County, Pennsylvania.  The main armory building was built in 1938, and was an "I"-plan building in the Moderne style.  The front section housed administrative functions and the rear was the former two-story stable area for the cavalry unit.  Between these sections was the riding hall, which had a round arched roof.  It was one of nine armories built in Pennsylvania between 1912 and 1938.  Demolished.[2]

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.[1]
