Sedgwick County Courthouse



The Sedgwick County Courthouse, located at 315 Cedar St. in Julesburg, Colorado, was built during 1938-39 by the Works Progress Administration (WPA).  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007; the listing included two contributing buildings.[1]

It was deemed significant in social history for representing federal relief programs;  its construction provided "much needed assistance by giving jobs to the unemployed of the county during the Great Depression."[2]

It also was deemed significant architecturally, as "an excellent example of the Art Deco style as applied to a government building whose construction was constrained by the economic conditions of the Depression."  It was designed by Jamieson and Stiffler, architects of Denver.[2]
