Newark Paramount Theatre



The Newark Paramount Theatre is an abandoned vaudeville house turned "movie palace" film theatre in the Four Corners Historic District in Downtown Newark, New Jersey.[1][2]

History
The theatre opened in 1886 and closed in 1986.[3][4]  The owner retained Scottish-born American architect Thomas W. Lamb to expand and renovate the house into an ornate movie palace in the early 20th century.[5][6][7][8]  The interior of the theater still stands, albeit dilapidated, and the marquee and signage remain intact.[9] The comedian Jerry Lewis worked as an usher at the theater in his youth.[10][11]
It took the name "Paramount" circa 1930.[12] Billie Holiday performed there.[13]

The theatre's facade, slightly adjusted during production to read "New Art," appeared as the movie theater in front of which Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck worked as an advertising clown in the 2019 Todd Phillips film Joker.[14][15][16]

The theater's roof collapsed in 2021.[17]
