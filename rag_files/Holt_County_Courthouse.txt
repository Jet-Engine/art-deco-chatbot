The Holt County Courthouse in O'Neill, Nebraska is a historic building that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  It is located on N. 4th St. between E. Clay and Benton Streets.  It was built in 1936.[1]

The courthouse was deemed significant for its architecture and its historic association with politics and local government.  It was found to be "a good example of public architecture in the county" and to be a "good example of the County Citadel Property Type".  The courthouse was one of seven built by Federal works programs during the Great Depression.
