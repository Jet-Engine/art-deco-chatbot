The Paterson Building

The Paterson Building is a historic structure located at 653 South Saginaw Street and Third Street in Flint, Michigan. It was built by William A. Paterson of the W. A. Paterson Company who first built carriages there starting in 1869. He switched to manufacturing automobiles in 1909, and the company built well-regarded automobiles until 1923.[1]

The building was damaged by fire and rebuilt in 1931 in the art deco style.[2] The Paterson building had been owned by Thomas W. Collison Jr. of the Collison Family for 30 years under their parent corporation Thomas W. Collison & Co., Inc.

The building consists of mainly law and medical offices. There are also retail stores on the Third Street side.
