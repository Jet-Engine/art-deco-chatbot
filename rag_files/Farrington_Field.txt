Farrington Field

Farrington Field is an 18,500-capacity multi-use stadium located in Fort Worth, Texas. Designed by Preston M. Geren, the stadium was financed with federal funds from the WPA and a local contribution from the school district. Designed in the PWA/Clssical style of moderne architecture, the stadium was completed in 1939 and was named in memory of E.S. Farrington, a long time superintendent of the Fort Worth Independent School District. In 1986 local preservationists succeeded in preserving the stadium. The stadium is the 2nd largest in Fort Worth proper and is used mainly for football and track & field.[1]

In February 2021, the parking lots of the stadium were used to stage a drive-through COVID-19 vaccination site.[2]

The field recently underwent a returfing along with the other FWISD owned football stadiums in 2022.
