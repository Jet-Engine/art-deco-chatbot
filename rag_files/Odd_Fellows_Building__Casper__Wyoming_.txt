Odd Fellows Building (Casper, Wyoming)



The Odd Fellow Building or Odd Fellows Building, now known as Wolcott Galleria, is a historic building in Casper, Wyoming. It was built in 1952 and designed by architect Jan Wilking of local architectural firm Goodrich & Wilking.  Casper's economy was then doing well and this building, unusual for Casper, was built with an arcade of first floor shops.  The Odd Fellows used the second floor, which had a double-height ballroom.  There were offices on the third.[2]

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.[1]

This building is now known as the "Wolcott Galleria", and home to home to a number of retail shops, as well as a banquet hall.
