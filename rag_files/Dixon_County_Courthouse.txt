Dixon County Courthouse



The Dixon County Courthouse in Ponca, Nebraska was built in 1883–84 and expanded in 1939–1940.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.[1]

The original courthouse has elements of Italianate architecture.  The addition was designed by Lincoln architect J.F. Reynolds and is in Art Deco style.[2]

It is a contributing property in the NRHP-listed Ponca Historic District.

The construction of the addition was the last salvo in a war between Ponca and Allen, Nebraska about which town would be county seat.[2]
