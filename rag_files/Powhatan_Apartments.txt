Powhatan Apartments



The Powhatan or Powhatan Apartments is a 22-story luxury apartment building overlooking Lake Michigan and adjacent to Burnham Park in the Kenwood neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois.[2] The building was designed by architects Robert De Golyer and Charles L. Morgan.[3]  Much of the Art Deco detailing is attributed to Morgan who was associated with Frank Lloyd Wright. The exterior of the luxury-apartment highrise reflects Eliel Saarinen's second place design for the Tribune Tower competition of 1922.[3] The building's terra-cotta ornamental panels feature conventionalized scenes based upon Native American culture.

This housing cooperative is a residential high-rise on Chicago's South Side.[4]  The building also hosts the only 24-hour elevator operators in Chicago.[4] Since it and many of the neighboring high-rise apartment buildings are named for Native American tribes (such as the Algonquin, The Chippewa and the Narragansett), the area has been given the tongue-in-cheek name "Indian Village".[5] It was designated a Chicago Landmark on January 12, 1993.[6]
