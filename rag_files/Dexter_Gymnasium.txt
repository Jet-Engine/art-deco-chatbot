Dexter Gymnasium

Dexter Gymnasium is a historic gymnasium located at Dexter, Stoddard County, Missouri.  It was built in 1939-1940 during the Great Depression on a block donated to the local school system, and shares the block with a school and library. It is a rectangular two-story, Art Deco-style, reinforced concrete and brick building. It measures 88 feet by 96 feet and has a gentle geodesic arch roof. "The 
fourteen "ziggurat"-styled support columns or buttresses, seven each along the north and south facades,
with their incised vertical lines, are an excellent example of this Art Deco style."[2]: 5 

The school district built a new gymnasium in 1960, and this building was adapted for community use. In 1996 the school district donated the building and property to the city.[2] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.[1]
