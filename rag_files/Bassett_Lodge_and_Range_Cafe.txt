Galleher in Moderne style.  It is designated Nebraska historic resource RO01-041 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.[1]

It was deemed significant for its association with business in Bassett and for its architecture.  It was built as a hotel and cafe to serve cattle buyers at the Bassett Livestock Auction, which attracted buyers nationwide.  It was built around a 1925-26-built hotel building;  the 1949-51 construction added Streamline Moderne lines.  As of the date of NRHP nomination, the building was very well preserved.[2]
