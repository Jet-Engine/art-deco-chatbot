Sentinel Island Light



[2]

The Sentinel Island Light is a lighthouse in Alaska adjacent to Lynn Canal.

Location
The Sentinel Island Light is at the northern entrance to the Favorite Channel, between the mainland and Lincoln and Shelter Islands. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 2, 2002.

History
On August 5, 1910, the steamship Princess May grounded on rocks just north of Sentinel Island. Although the ship was successfully taken off the rocks on September 5, 1910, photographic images showing the ship pointing in the air at low tide became famous.[5]

The 1930s lighthouse, replacing an earlier wooden structure, was built for $35,310.[6] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.[4] Other than the lighthouse, the district included four other contributing buildings, four contributing structures, and two contributing sites.[6]
