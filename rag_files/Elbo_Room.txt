Elbo Room

The Elbo Room is a bar that was established in 1938 at 241 South Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard, Fort Lauderdale, Florida and that became a landmark for Fort Lauderdale Beach.[1] The bar was featured in the 1960 film Where the Boys Are.[2] Its location at the corner of Las Olas Boulevard places it on one end of the Fort Lauderdale strip. It is well-known for being the host of multiple surfing and boogie boarding championships in the late 1980s and early 1990', and a boogie-boarding competition won by Jason Goodman in 1988 was the signature event during this time period. The Penrod family purchased it in 1981.
