Curry County Courthouse



The Curry County Courthouse in Clovis, New Mexico is a three-and-a-half-story Art Deco-style courthouse which was built in 1936.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.[1][2]

It was designed by architect Robert E. Merrell of Schaefer & Merrell architectural firm.  It was expanded in 1954 with a two-story addition, also designed by Robert E. Merrell, over the site of the preceding 1910 courthouse.[2]

Merrell also designed the NRHP-listed Hotel Clovis, at 210 Main St. in Clovis, and the NRHP-listed Roosevelt County Courthouse at 100 W. 2nd St. in Portales, New Mexico.[1]
