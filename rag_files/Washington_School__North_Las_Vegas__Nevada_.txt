It is a one-story Moderne building holding two classrooms. It is roughly 25 by 85 feet (7.6 m × 25.9 m) in plan, with a somewhat cruciform plan created by a projecting entry and a rear restroom adding onto an otherwise rectangular structure.  It is built upon a concrete foundation, with concrete block walls divided into bays by Moderne style pilasters.  It has a flat roof behind a parapet.[2]
