Corvallis High School (Oregon)



Corvallis High School (CHS) is a four-year public secondary school in Corvallis, Oregon.  Originally established in 1910, the high school sat between the downtown area of Corvallis and Oregon State University. In 1935, a new school was built on what was then considered the far northern edge of the town on approximately 25 acres. In 2005, a third structure was built on the site of the former one in what is now considered a central part of the city. Corvallis High School is one of two traditional secondary schools in the Corvallis School District, the other being Crescent Valley High School on the northern edge of the city.

Building
1910 structure
The original Corvallis High School was opened in February 1910 on 6th Street between Monroe Avenue and Madison Avenue, becoming the first dedicated high school in Corvallis.  Prior to the construction, all grades were housed in Corvallis Central School, which was built in 1889 and was located one block west on 7th Street.[1] The new high school was built in an Arts and Crafts style. The structure was built of masonry and featured two stories on top of a daylight basement.  After only one year open, administration had already decided that the school was not large enough.  A $40,000 bond measure was passed to expand the existing structure.

In 1917, an expanded and remodeled building was opened.  The Arts and Crafts styling from the original building did not remain with the remodel and was changed to a Beaux-Arts style facade.  The remodeled school had 22 classrooms as well as a gymnasium that doubled as an auditorium.

The schools population continued to grow.  In 1920 a two-room portable classroom was added.  In the 1930s, Corvallis High School had reached a population of 650 students in a structure that was intended for 400.  It was decided that a larger school was needed.

When the 1935 high school opened, the 1910 building was converted to use as the junior high school until it was destroyed by fire in 1946.[6]

1935 structure
In 1933, the citizens of Corvallis passed a local bond to pay for the construction.  This allowed the school district to apply for a Public Works Administration grant and loan, which was awarded in January 1934.[1] The Portland firm of Whitehouse, Stanton, and Church was selected to design the new school.  The Corvallis School District selected the site for the new high school on 11th Street, on the far northwest edge of town. The new Art Deco structure was completed in 1935.  The project cost $316,000.  The building was expanded multiple times in the 50s and 60s, with the addition of the science and library wing as well as the cafeteria and a large gym addition.

In the spring of 2000, after the district finished a seismic analysis of its 17 schools,[7] it was decided that the building was unsafe for student use. It was decided that the replacement should be built on the existing site, favoring the central location over the opportunity to gain more land at an alternative location. This decision also required the old building to be demolished, which upset some citizens who believed the building to be a historic treasure.[8]

In an effort to save the structure, the building was nominated and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.[9] However, in the spring of 2004, construction began on the new building and the historic building was later demolished, and thus it was removed from the register.[10][11]  Several small architectural items from the original school were salvaged and used in the new building, including two brass chandeliers from the school's original auditorium, and two wrought iron "Juliet"-style decorative balconies from the school's east-facing facade, which were integrated into the new theater.

2005 structure
After the seismic analysis in 2000, it was decided that a new high school needed to be built.[1] The citizens of Corvallis passed an $86.4 million bond measure in 2002 to replace the high school as well as two middle schools, and also to update and renovate other schools in the district. Construction began in 2004 on the same lot as the second building in the old student parking lot, tennis courts, and football field/track, while classes continued in the old school. The second Corvallis High School structure was torn down in the summer of 2005 and was replaced with a softball field and a parking lot. The original front parking lot still remains, as well as several auxiliary buildings along Dixon Creek that were built in the 1960s.

This third Corvallis High School building, facing Buchanan Street, was opened in the fall of 2005. Originally slated to be opened in January 2006, construction was far enough along to allow the 2005-06 school year to start in the new structure while construction continued on-site until the spring of 2006. The cost of construction for the 230,000-square-foot (21,000Â m2) school was $46 million, and it was designed by Dull Olsen Weekes Architects of Portland. Conscientious effort was made to build an energy-efficient, sustainable school, achieving a LEED silver rating for high performance buildings. The school is expected to use 30% less energy than one built to standard Oregon code.[12]
