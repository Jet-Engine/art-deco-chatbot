A & P Food Stores Building

The A & P Food Stores Building in St. Louis, Missouri, is historically significant in part because it is rare in Saint Louis as a small commercial building having an Art Deco building design.  Most others were either residential or larger commercial buildings.  It also serves as an example of the work of Saum Architects, a not-well-known architectural firm of Saint Louis in the early 1900s.  And it is also significant as having been one of the first supermarkets in St. Louis that was developed to serve automobile-owning customers, providing parking and convenient "one-stop shopping".[2]: 13 

There were as many as 84 A & P stores in the city, 20 being supermarkets and the others being cash and carry stores; this building is one of the last surviving of these, and it was among those which kept operating up until A & P entirely left the city in 1979–1980.[2]: 18 

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.[1]
