History
The Berwyn State Bank, which was founded in 1909, opened the building on June 7, 1930.[2] It occupied the building’s second floor.[1] For many years, Schoen–McAllister, a dry goods store, was located on the ground floor.[4][5][6] Much of the fifth floor was leased to physicians.[4]

The Berwyn State Bank purchased the property where the building stands on November 25, 1914.[2] Title to the building was transferred to the Berwyn State Company on May 27, 1930, and the Oak Park Federal Savings Bank on June 1, 1930.[2] The Berwyn State Bank failed on June 27, 1931.[7] The building was sold to Blackstone Realty in 1947 for $275,000, and the Commercial National Bank was formed and began operating in the building.[8][9] In the 1960s Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's West Suburban district office was located in the building.[10] In 1970, it was sold to MacNeal Memorial Hospital.[2][3] In 2003, MacNeal sold the building to HSA Commercial Real Estate.[2][3] The building was recognized as a Berwyn Historic Landmark, along with the Berwyn National Bank Building, in 2008.[3]
