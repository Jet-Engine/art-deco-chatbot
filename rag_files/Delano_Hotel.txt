Delano South Beach

The Delano South Beach hotel is an upscale resort located in Miami Beach, Florida, currently under renovations.[1] The Delano was a part of the Morgans Hotel Group collection prior to MHG being purchased by SBE Entertainment Group. SBE Entertainment has since sold the hotel to Eldridge Industries, and the hotel has been closed to the public since March 2020.[2]

The hotel is located directly on the beach. The Delano was known for its whimsical, art deco styling and its celebrity clientele, and its pool was one of the few hotel pools in Miami Beach where female toplessness was allowed.[3] In 2007, the Delano South Beach was ranked in the American Institute of Architects list of "America's Favorite Architecture".[4] On April 18, 2012, the AIA's Florida Chapter placed the Delano South Beach on its list Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places.[5]

History
Designed by architect Robert Swartburg, the Delano was built in 1947 by Rob and Rose Schwartz. The hotel was originally utilized for military housing. The then four-winged art deco tower of the Delano was the tallest building in Miami Beach. The 1994 renovations were designed by Philippe Starck.[6]
The hotel was named after US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
