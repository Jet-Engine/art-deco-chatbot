Klingle Valley Bridge

The Klingle Valley Bridge, officially known as the Connecticut Avenue Bridge, is an Art Deco steel-arch bridge located near the National Zoological Park on Connecticut Avenue, Northwest in Washington, D.C. The bridge crosses Klingle Valley, running from Macomb Street to Devonshire Place and connecting the Cleveland Park and Woodley Park neighborhoods.[2]

The bridge replaced an earlier one built around 1890 by real estate developer and sitting U.S. Representative Francis Newlands, D-Nevada, as part of his effort to create the streetcar suburb of Chevy Chase, Maryland.[3]

The bridge was designed by architect Paul Philippe Cret and engineer Ralph Modjeski. It was built in 1931â€“1932. There is no direct connection between Connecticut Avenue and Klingle Road in the narrow valley below. The bridge features two historic lights on each corner. A major rehabilitation of the bridge that began in 2005 included restored ornamental lanterns, refurbished masonry, and additional street lights. The restoration project was completed in 2008.[4][5]

On May 21, 2004, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[4][6] It is a contributing property to the Cleveland Park Historic District.[5]
