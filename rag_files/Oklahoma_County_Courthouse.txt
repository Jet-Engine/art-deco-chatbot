It replaced the original courthouse that was built with $100,000 in bonds issued and located at the intersection of California and Robinson at 520 West Main Street in the 1900s.

The building is located at 321 Park Avenue[3] It cost $1.5 million paid for with a bond issue and money from the Public Works Administration (PWA), "a federal program to create jobs in The Great Depression.[4]

The 11-floor concrete courthouse  building is considered art deco / art moderne and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.[5] Quotes are inscribed in the "sandy-brown Indiana limestone" and a carved mural depicts "a scene of Oklahoma friendship" between a Native American figure and a Mountain Man.[4]

The building is said to be "loosely abstracted from stepped-back Mayan temples" and includes a two-story lobby with terrazzo floor with a compass design as well as abstracted wagon wheel chandeliers and third story overlooks.[4] In 1967 a modern architecture building was constructed next to the courthouse and connected by a walkway.

The courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 5, 1992.[1]
