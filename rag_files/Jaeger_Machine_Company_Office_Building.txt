Jaeger Machine Company Office Building

The Jaeger Machine Company Office Building is a historic building in the Arena District neighborhood of Columbus, Ohio. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[1][2]

The two-story concrete building was constructed in 1936. It was designed simply and affordably, but with Art Deco features for a modern design. The design was by O. G. Mandt, company president, and Lyon Gardner, an engineer. The company was founded in 1906 and successfully produced cement mixers.[2] It declined over time, finally shuttering in 1992.[3]

The building stands as a rare example of the Art Deco movement for industrial buildings in Columbus.[4]
