Shreve, Crump & Low

Shreve, Crump & Low, a Boston, Massachusetts business, is the oldest purveyor of luxury goods in North America, responsible for  trophies such as the Davis Cup and the Cy Young Award.[1][2]

History
Established in 1796 by watchmaker and silversmith John McFarlane, the company is one of the oldest jewelry stores in North America.[3][4][5]

The present-day Shreve, Crump & Low is the last of a line of firms that began with John McFarlane, who opened a workshop across the street from Paul Revere. In the 1800s, the firm changed its name to Shreve's. In 1869 the firm of Shreve, Crump & Low was formed by merger.[1]

Shreve, Crump & Low remained at their original location until their property was destroyed in the Great Boston Fire of 1872.  Its new location at 225 Washington Street pioneered the use of plate glass and artificial lighting in a retail establishment.  This Italianate building had showcases of black walnut trimmed with holly and ebony.[1][2]

A relocation in 1891 brought Shreve, Crump & Low to its largest building, a six stories high Italian Renaissance style edifice of limestone and marble designed by Henry Forbes Bigelow.[6] In 1929, Shreve, Crump & Low moved to 330 Boylston Street, one of the earliest examples of art deco architecture in New England.[1] In 2006, under the ownership of local jeweler, David Walker, the firm opened a new store in Bostonâ€™s Back Bay at the corner of Boylston and Berkeley Streets. 

Shreve's has also sold antiques, imported fine linen and stationery, and exhibited artifacts from Ancient Greece and Rome. Shreve, Crump & Low is known for classic fine jewelry and timepieces, tableware, and Boston-themed gifts.  

In 1974, Shreve, Crump & Low opened a second location at The Mall at Chestnut Hill[2] and it closed in 2009. In May 2012, the Boylston Street store relocated to 39 Newbury Street, Boston.

In 2014, another store was opened in Greenwich, CT.
