Westhope

Westhope, also known as the Richard Lloyd Jones House, is a Frank Lloyd Wright designed Textile Block home that was constructed in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1929. This was Wright's only Textile Block house outside of California.[2]  The client, Richard Lloyd Jones, was Wright's cousin and the publisher of the Tulsa Tribune.

This building is located at 3704 South Birmingham Avenue.[3] The home has five bedrooms and five baths.[3]  It encompasses 10,405 square feet on 1.5 acres.[3] Besides the textile blocks stacked in vertical columns, the home features 5,200 panes of glass covering almost half the exterior of the structure.[3][4]  It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places listings in Tulsa County, Oklahoma on April 10, 1975 under National Register Criteria C, g, with an NRIS number of 75001575.[5]

Westhope is the location of a frequently-quoted anecdote about Wright: Richard Lloyd Jones called Wright in the middle of a storm to complain that the roof was leaking on his desk, and Wright replied, "Richard, why don't you move your desk?"[6][7]  But Jones’ wife Georgia had an equally memorable perspective regarding the leaking structure: she said, “This is what we get for leaving a work of art out in the rain.”[8]

Jones paid over $100,000 for construction, even though the original budget was $30,000.[3]  After Jones' death in 1963, his widow traded houses with M. Murray McCune, a Tulsa architect who updated Westhope in 1965.[4]  By mid-2017, the owner of the house was Barbara Tyson, a member of the family that founded Tyson Foods Inc.[8]  The structure was purchased by Stuart Price in October 2021, who made extensive renovations including re-waterproofing and tuckpointing cracked blocks.[3]

The house is one of only three Wright structures in Oklahoma, the others being in Bartlesville: the Harold Price Jr. House and the 19-story Price Tower.[3]
