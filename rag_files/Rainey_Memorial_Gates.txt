Rainey Memorial Gates



Rainey Memorial Gates is a historic entrance gate located at the north side of the Bronx Zoo, within Bronx Park in the Bronx, New York City. It was built in 1934 and constructed of sculpted bronze in the Art Deco style. It was designed by noted sculptor Paul Manship (1885–1966), who worked on them starting in 1926. It stands as a memorial to noted big game hunter Paul James Rainey (1877–1923). The gates feature stylized animal and plant life including the figure of a seated lion.  Low bronze screens flank the gate and connect it to the granite gatekeepers lodges. 

It is a New York City designated landmark and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.[1]
