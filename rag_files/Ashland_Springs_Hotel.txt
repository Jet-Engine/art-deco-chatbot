The Ashland Springs Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.[3] The hotel was built before the Great Depression, originally as the Litha Springs Hotel.[4] It was built as a first-class hotel to draw visitors to the area, designed by the architectural firm Tourtellotte & Hummel with reinforced concrete with architectural elements that reflected a Romanesque, Gothic, and Neo-Classical Revival style.[4] It was planned to be the tallest building between Portland and San Francisco. The design of the hotel was similar to that of the Boise Hotel and the Baker Hotel, featuring a nine-story central tower with two short wings.[4]

In 1961, the hotel was renamed to the Mark Antony Motor Hotel. Due to economic issues, the owner undertook an extensive restoration of the hotel under the National Park Service's Certified Rehabilitation program for which the owners received a preservation tax credit.[4]
