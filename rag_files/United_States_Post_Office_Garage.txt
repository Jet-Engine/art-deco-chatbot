United States Post Office Garage

The US Post Office Garage was a historic vehicle maintenance facility at 135 A Street in the South Boston neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.  The two story building was designed in the International Style by Gilbert Underwood and completed in 1941 by a construction team headed by John Volpe.  It was built out of reinforced concrete and steel.  Its exterior was scored in a way to give the appearance of paneling, and had large expanses of steel sash windows that typified the International style.  Its rounded corners gave it a streamlined appearance.[2]

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.[1]  It has since been demolished.[2]
