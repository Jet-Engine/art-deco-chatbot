AFI Silver



AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center (commonly called as AFI Silver) is a three-screen movie theater complex in downtown Silver Spring, Maryland, north of Washington, D.C.[1] It is operated by the American Film Institute.

It occupies the former home of the 1,100-seat Silver Theatre, whose 1938 building was designed by movie palace architect John Eberson.[2] The Silver Theatre closed in 1985, and the building stood empty until 2001, when restoration began.[3]

Today[when?], the theater shows "upward of 600 movies per year" including "first-run features, classics, obscure archival prints, rarities from global cinema and the odd locally made one-off", The Washington Post wrote in 2017.[4]

Its main auditorium hosts the DC Metro area's third-largest commercial movie theater screen, and the second-largest commercial movie theater screen outside of the Smithsonian Institution after the Uptown Theater in Cleveland Park.

From 2003 to 2022, the theater hosted an annual documentary festival called Silverdocs and then AFI Docs.[5]
