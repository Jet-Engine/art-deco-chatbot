Dual State Monument

The Dual State Monument is a monument located on the border of Union County, Arkansas, and Union Parish, Louisiana. The monument was built in 1931 to mark the centennial of the establishment of the Arkansas-Louisiana state line. It also marks the birthplace of Arkansas governor George Washington Donaghey, who commissioned the monument after his retirement. The monument features Art Deco bas-relief carvings on its east and west sides. The east side features popular modes of transportation in 1831, including a steamboat, stagecoach, and covered wagon. The west side displays a locomotive, automobile, and airplane to represent the modes of transportation common in 1931. The monument was the first Art Deco-inspired sculpture erected in Arkansas.[2]

The monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 11, 2000.[1]
