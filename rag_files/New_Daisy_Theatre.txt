History
In 1942, Paul and Sam Zerilla and their business partner, Joe Maceri, the owners of the original Daisy Theatre, opened the New Daisy Theatre at 330 Beale Street. The Zerillas and Maceri wanted to create a bigger performance space for popular acts.

In the first few decades after its opening, the New Daisy Theatre was primarily a movie theatre, but sometimes hosted live acts.

It had fallen into disrepair by the 1970s, and while several buildings around it were demolished, both the Old Daisy and New Daisy remained intact.[4]

In the early 1980s, boxing promoter Mike Glenn began leasing the New Daisy and hosting matches. While boxing helped the theatre financially at the beginning, eventually Glenn began to host concerts, largely of rock music, which drew in more money than the boxing, although the latter continued. Glenn sold the New Daisy in Nov of 2014 hosting John Hiatt as the last national act under his storied tenure which hosted many legendary artists and nationally televised boxing matches.

In 2014 Steve Adelman and J.W. Gibson purchased the F.G.H. Corporation and the New Daisy Theatre, and in 2015 they invested $500,000 to renovate it. The renovation added a new floor, VIP areas, new bars, as well as new sound and lighting systems.[5] Acts booked for the first two month included Seether, Drive-By Truckers, Joey Bada$$, Public Image Ltd., Everclear, and Steve Earle.[6]

In 2019, Adelman was charged with writing a fraudulent check to former owner Mike Glenn. The charges were then dropped by police due to false claims.[7] Adelman claimed that he intended to file a civil suit against Glenn “to address the wrongful conduct and hold parties accountable for their actions.”[8][9]

Spearheaded by Jon Shivers, with the Downtown Memphis Commission, The New Daisy Theatre will be reopening in 2023 and will play host to local & national touring acts as well as corporate & private events.[10]
