The Lincoln Theatre on Lincoln Road in the South Beach neighborhood of Miami Beach, Florida was a movie theater and later a concert hall. It was designed in art deco style by noted cinema and theater designer Thomas W. Lamb and opened in 1936. It functioned as a cinema until the 1980s, then sat vacant for several years, then was used for performances of the New World Symphony, which bought it in 1990. The symphony carried out a multimillion-dollar renovation.[1][2]

The symphony moved to the new and much larger Frank Gehry-designed New World Center in 2011, and already before that in February 2010, Clifford Stein purchased the building to turn into retail shops.[3] In January 2012, H&M was signed as the first tenant. As of February 2012 the property was in the process of being converted to retail, with much of the interior gutted.[4] On April 18, 2012, the American Institute of Architects's Florida Chapter placed the building on its list of Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places as Lincoln Theater.[5]
