The Leeman Auto Company Building, at 550 Broadway in Denver, Colorado, United States, was built in 1932 and expanded in 1934.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.[1]

It is an L-shaped one-story Art Deco-style building built of brick and terra cotta to serve as an automobile showroom and service facility.[2]
