Wynne Post Office

The Wynne Post Office is located at 402 East Merriman Street in Wynne, Arkansas. It is a single-story brick structure, with a built-up parapet obscuring a flat roof. A recent addition extends to the rear. The building was built in 1936 at a cost to the federal government of $65,000. It is most notable for the mural that adorns its main lobby, titled Cotton Pickers, which was created by Ethel Magafan with funding from the United States Treasury Department's Section of Art, a Depression-era jobs program for artists.[2]

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.[1]
