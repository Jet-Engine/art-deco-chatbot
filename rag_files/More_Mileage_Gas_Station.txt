More Mileage Gas Station



The More Mileage Gas Station, located at 602 North Main in Jennings in Jefferson Davis Parish, Louisiana, is a historic filling station which was built in 1938.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 22, 2004.[1]

It was deemed to be "locally significant in the history of transportation as a rare surviving example of a once considerably more common building type in the Jefferson Davis parish seat of Jennings. Historic filling stations are icons of the early automobile age, but given the ever-changing world of commerce, they are becoming a rare breed."[2][3]
