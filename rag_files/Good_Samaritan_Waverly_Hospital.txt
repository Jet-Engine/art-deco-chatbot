Good Samaritan-Waverly Hospital

Good Samaritan-Waverly Hospital, also known as “Good Sam” Hospital and Waverly Hospital, is a historic hospital for African-American patients located in Columbia, South Carolina. It was built in 1952, and is a two-story, brick building in the Moderne style. The hospital housed a pharmacy, laboratory, X-ray room, staff dining room, two operating rooms, and 50 beds to service the local community. The hospital closed in August 1973.[2][3]

The hospital building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.[1] In addition to its National Register of Historic Places status, it falls within the boundaries of Waverly Protection Area, a Preservation District within the City of Columbia Urban Design and Historic Preservation District system,[4] as well as Waverly Historic District.

In 2020, Allen University announced that their renovation of the Hospital would include a memorial that will prominently feature the names of Clementa C. Pinckney and the other eight individuals slain at Emanual African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015.[5] Pinckney was a graduate of Allen University and Pastor at Emanual AME Church.[6] Two other Charleston Church Shooting victims, Tywanza Sanders and Rev. Daniel L. Simmons Sr., were also Allen University graduates.[7] [8]
