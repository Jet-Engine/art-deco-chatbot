The facade and its architectural sculpture by Chicago-born artist Gwen Lux were designated a Chicago Landmark on February 7, 1997.[1] The building was demolished in 1998;[2]  however, its facade was saved and reinstalled in 2000 on the new Le Méridien Chicago hotel building.[3] The hotel was renamed the Conrad Chicago in 2005.[4] The hotel was again renamed in 2015, becoming The Gwen, for sculptor Gwen Lux,[5] and is part of The Luxury Collection.[6] It was constructed by the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, whose Midwestern headquarters served as the original anchor tenant.[7]
