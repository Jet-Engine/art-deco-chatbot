History
Huntington Center
Early Years
The Huntington Center was the first enclosed, all-weather mall in Orange County. It was constructed at a cost of $20,000,000 and opened in 1966 with 55 retailers occupying a total of 842,855 square feet (78,303.8 m2) of retail space on a 58-acre (23 ha) lot, and parking for 3,700 cars.[1][2]

The mall originally had 4 anchor stores:[3]

Additional tenants at opening included Lerner's, Judy's, Harris & Frank, Leed's, Kinney Shoes, Thom McAn, Security First National Bank, Crocker-Citizens National Bank Food Fair supermarket and Thrifty Drug Stores.[3] An eight-ton statue from Budapest, Hungary was installed in the center of the mall.[3]

Later Years
In November 1986, a new wing opened, with Mervyn's added as its fourth anchor store and a new food court. In November 1993, JCPenney closed and relocated to the nearby Westminster Mall.
In 1995, Burlington Coat Factory replaced JCPenney. Barnes & Noble opened that October, moving into the long-vacant former Barker Bros. building.[4] In August 1996, The Broadway closed, after the company was purchased by Macy's and liquidated. The wing between the shuttered The Broadway building and Burlington Coat Factory was closed and sealed off shortly thereafter, as the mall's business begins to decline rapidly.

Closure
In 2000, Burlington Coat Factory sued the mall's owners, claiming they were being "forced out" during the mall's redevelopment.[5] In March 2001, Montgomery Ward became the last original anchor store to close, when the parent chain was liquidated. The mall itself closed in 2003, except for Mervyn's and Burlington Coat Factory. The mall was demolished soon afterward, except for the four anchor structures - Burlington Coat Factory, Mervyn's, and the empty Montgomery Ward and The Broadway buildings.

Bella Terra
Bella Terra opened in 2006, with Kohl's in the old The Broadway building. In 2008, Mervyn's closed due to liquidation and Circuit City closed due to bankruptcy. In 2010, the vacant Montgomery Ward and Mervyn's buildings were demolished.[6] That same year, Whole Foods Market opened in the former Circuit City location. Costco opened in May 2012.[7] In 2013, The Residences at Bella Terra, a 467-unit apartment complex with retail space on the ground level, opened on the site of the former Montgomery Ward anchor buoilding.[8]
