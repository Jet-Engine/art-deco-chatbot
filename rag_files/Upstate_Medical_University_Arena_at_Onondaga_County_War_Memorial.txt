Previous teams to call the War Memorial home included the NBA's Syracuse Nationals, the NLL's  Syracuse Smash, the Major Arena Soccer League's Syracuse Silver Knights, and several now-defunct American Hockey League teams. The Nationals defeated the Fort Wayne Pistons in a deciding seventh game at home to win the 1954–55 NBA Championship. The War Memorial also hosted the NBA All-Star Game in 1961[9] and the NCAA Frozen Four in 1967 and 1971.[10] The Syracuse Orange women's ice hockey occasionally play their games at the arena, having played 13 games there since 2008.[11]
