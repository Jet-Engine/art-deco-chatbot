Ward County Courthouse



The Ward County Courthouse in Minot, North Dakota was built in 1929.  Along with two other "distinctive county buildings in North Dakota", the Barnes County Courthouse and the Burke County Courthouse, it was designed by the Minneapolis, Minnesota, firm Toltz, King, and Day.[2]

Costing $498,000, it was the most expensive county courthouse built in the state for almost 30 years.[3]

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.[1]
