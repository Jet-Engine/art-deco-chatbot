Railroad Park is a 19-acre park in Birmingham, Alabama, United States, that opened in the fall of 2010.  It was designed by landscape architect Tom Leader and built by Birmingham-based Brasfield & Gorrie.  The park lies immediately south of the Norfolk Southern and CSX rail lines through downtown Birmingham.  It stretches from 14th Street to 18th Street along First Avenue South.  UAB Hospital and Children's Hospital of Alabama are several blocks south of the park.  The park is a public facility owned by the City of Birmingham and managed by the non-profit Railroad Park Foundation.

In 2016 Rotary Trail was opened, which connects Railroad Park to Sloss Furnaces through a pedestrian greenway.
