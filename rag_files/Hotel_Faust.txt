Hotel Faust

The Faust Hotel, once known as the Travelers Hotel, was completed in 1929 and is located in New Braunfels, Texas. The hotel planning was started by a group of citizens desiring to attract tourist and convention traffic to counter a downturn in agricultural business caused by a mid-1920s drought in the area. Built on donated land from Senator Joseph Faust's estate, the hotel was renamed in 1936 in honor that family. The building is a four-story masonry design of no particular architectural style, though with some Spanish Renaissance Revival detailing.[2]

It has been renovated several times through the years, but is one of the few known Texas mid-rise hotels of its era still serving as a hotel.[2] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.[1]

Not to be confused with Hotel Faust (now Hotel Giles since 2015) in Comfort, Texas.[3]
