Ogden/Weber Municipal Building



The Ogden/Weber Municipal Building, at 2541 Washington Blvd. in Ogden, Utah, was built in 1938â€“1940.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[1]

It was funded as a Public Works Administration project.  It was designed by architects Hodgson and McClenahan in Art Deco style and built by George A. Whitmeyer & Sons.  It is built of warm brick and glazed terra cotta.[2]

Its nomination claims that "In many ways it is a 'typical' Art Deco example, resembling the Syracuse Lighting Company Office Building (1932), in Syracuse, New York",[2] but frankly it is a great deal less spectacular than that extraordinary example.
