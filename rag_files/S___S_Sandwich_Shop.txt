S & S Sandwich Shop

The S & S Sandwich Shop (also known as the S&S Diner and the S & S Restaurant) is a historic site in Miami, Florida. It is located at 1757 Northeast 2nd Avenue. On January 4, 1989, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.[2]

The small-scale, Art Deco building was constructed in 1938 and includes a facade of pigmented structural glass and aluminum arranged in horizontal and vertical bands of beige, white, and red.[3]

In 2017, the restaurant was evicted from the building, and the S & S Diner resumed at a nearby location.[4]
