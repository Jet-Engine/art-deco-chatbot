Princess Sweet Shop (Iowa Falls, Iowa)

The Princess Sweet Shop is a historic building located in Iowa Falls, Iowa, United States.  It is noted as "an outstanding example of Art Deco design from 1935. The Carrara Glass fa√ßade, and streamlined woodwork are typical of Art Deco design of the 1920s and 1930s, but a rarity in a small town in Iowa."[2]  Ernie Karrys(Karamitsanis) and Nicholas P. Pergakis opened the Princess in 1915. Two years later, The Sweet Shop opened by Harry Pergakis. These three men were born in the town of Asprokampos, Greece. It was common for Greek immigrants to establish candy shop around the U.S.[3] They combined their operations at the Princess location in 1928.  Sadly, Nicholas died of cancer in September 1928 at age 39.<relative of N. Pergakis> The building was destroyed in a fire on December 25, 1934.  Local architect L.L. Klippel  designed the new building, which was completed in 1935.  It was the first building in Iowa Falls that was air conditioned.[3]  Members of the Harry Perkagis family maintained ownership until 1987.  The business is still in operation as a soda fountain under different ownership.

The building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.   It was included as a contributing property in the Washington Avenue Commercial Historic District in 2012.[4]
