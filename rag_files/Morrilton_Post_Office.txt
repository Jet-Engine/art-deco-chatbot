Morrilton Post Office

The former Morrilton Post Office is a historic post office building at 117 North Division Street in downtown Morrilton, Arkansas.  It is a single-story masonry structure, built of brick and limestone in a simplified Art Deco style.  Its facade is divided into five bays, the outer two separated by brick piers from the inner three.  The inner three are articulated by limestone pilasters, and feature large multipane windows and the main entrance.  The interior features a mural entitled Men at Rest by Richard Sargent, painted in the 1930s as part of a federal works project.[2]

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.[1]

The building currently[when?] houses the Conway County Office of Emergency Management and Conway County 911 Services.
