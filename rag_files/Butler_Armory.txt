On June 23, 2010 Brig. Gen. Joseph De Paul dedicated the new Butler Readiness Center. The new facility, located at 250 Kriess Road, Renfrew, Pennsylvania, is home to Company A, 1st Battalion, 112th Infantry Regiment, 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team.[3] In addition to providing additional space for soldiers to work and train, it allows the soldiers of the Stryker Brigade to conduct the technical training required for the advanced systems they use during combat operations.
