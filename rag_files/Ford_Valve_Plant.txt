Ford Valve Plant

The Ford Valve Plant is a factory building located at 235 East Main Street in Northville, Michigan. The plant was built as part of Henry Ford's vision of decentralizing manufacturing and integrating it into rural communities.[2] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.[1]

"Village Industries"
Northville's Valve Plant was the first of Henry Ford's "Village Industries" factories.[3]  The Village industries were designed to bring the economic advantages of industrial jobs to rural communities through the establishment of decentralized, non-disruptive manufacturing plants.[2][3]  In particular, Ford intended the Village Industries to stabilize the income of farmers who would otherwise have little winter income,[3][4] and he gave his workers leaves of absence to work their farms.[5]

Over the span of the 1920s and 1930s, Ford established over thirty more Village Industries factories, making everything from copper welding rods to lamp assemblies to wheels.[3]  The plants tended to be small, employing around 100 workers. As in Northville, all of the factories were built on a riverbank (many at the former site of gristmills), and utilized hydroelectric power.[3][4]

History
Henry Ford purchased the property this building sits on in 1919.[2]   The lot contained an old gristmill which was reconfigured into a valve manufacturing facility by moving machinery in from the Fordson and Highland Park plants.[6] Between 1919 and 1936, the plant manufactured over 180 million valves,[6] at a cost of less than half what it would be in the larger Highland Park plant.[5]

In 1936, Ford replaced the mill with an Albert Kahn-designed factory building.[2]  The building reflects the then-current industrial architecture, as well as hints of Art Deco in the brickwork and entryway styling[7] but still incorporated a water wheel.[2]

The Village Industries program was discontinued in 1947, but the factory continued to produce valves.[2]   The building was enlarged in 1956, and in 1969 over 150,000 valves were produced every day.[6]  The plant continued operations until 1978, the longest lived of any former Village Industries factory,[2] and was later sold.[6]  The building has been renovated into office space for use by design firms, such as HKS, Inc., an architecture firm, and Spider9, an environmental technology developer.[8]
