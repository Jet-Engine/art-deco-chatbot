History and architectural features
Designed by Irwin T. Catharine, this historic structure was built between 1925 and 1926. It is a three-story, three-bay, brick building that sits on a raised basement. It was created in the Art Deco style. An addition was built in 1960. It features a freestanding portico with Doric order columns and decorative tile.[2] It is named for the civic leader Mary Channing Wister, the wife of Owen Wister.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.[1]

In 2001, the building was renovated to become a new forensic science laboratory for the Philadelphia Police Department.[3] While the facade remains true to the original design with little change, the inside of the building was completely renovated and designated a Green building. The new laboratory is called the Forensic Science Center, and is operated by the Office of Forensic Science within the Philadelphia Police Department.
