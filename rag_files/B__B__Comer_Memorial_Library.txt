B. B. Comer Memorial Library



The B.B. Comer Memorial Library is a library located in Sylacauga, Alabama. The library was named to the National Register of Historic Places on September 6, 2005.[1]

The library was founded in 1936 as the Sylacauga Public Library. It was moved three years later, and after a $5,000 grant by the family B. B. Comer, the library was renamed in his honor.[2] The library was again renamed to Isabel Anderson Comer Museum and Arts Center in 1962.[1] It was created with a marble exterior, and was originally built through the Works Progress Administration.[3]
