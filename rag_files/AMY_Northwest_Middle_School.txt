History and architectural features
The school consists of two distinct buildings. The original section was built between 1894 and 1896, and is a two-and-one-half-story, five-bay, stone building with a hipped roofhich was designed in the Colonial Revival style.[2]

A three-story addition was built immediately to the south of the first building between 1928 and 1929. It is a brick and stone Art Deco-style building designed by Irwin T. Catharine.[2]

Both buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.[1]

In 2012, the School Reform Commission of the Philadelphia School District closed it as an elementary school;[3] it then reopened as a selective admission middle school, AMY Northwest.[4]
