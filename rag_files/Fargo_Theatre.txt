Fargo Theatre

The Fargo Theatre is an art deco movie theater in downtown Fargo, North Dakota, United States. Construction on the building began in the fall of 1925 and the theatre opened on March 15, 1926.  It was restored in 1999 to its historic appearance and now is a center for the arts in the Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan area.  The Fargo Theatre is home to a 4-manual, 32-rank Wurlitzer Theatre Pipe Organ, known as the "Mighty Wurlitzer," which is owned and maintained by the Red River Theatre Organ Society, a non-profit organization and local chapter of the American Theatre Organ Society.

The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[1]
