Established by Maurice and Cyma Maisel in 1939 to cater to the new U.S. Route 66 tourist trade, this Pueblo Deco building was designed by architect John Gaw Meem. The building features murals designed by Olive Rush. Various murals depicting Indian life were painted by ten Pueblo and Navajo artists[4] such as Narcisco Abeyta, Harrison Begay, and Awa Tsireh[5] The trading post employed hundreds of native craftspeople in its heyday. It closed upon its founder's death, only to be reopened in the 1980s[6] by Maurice’s grandson, Skip. It continued to trade as Skip Maisel's Indian Jewelry and Crafts, until summer of 2019, when Skip Maisel retired and closed the business.[7]
