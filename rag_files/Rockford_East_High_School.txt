Rockford East High School

Rockford East High School (sometimes referred to as East) is a comprehensive four year high school of Rockford Public School District 205 in Rockford, Illinois.  Opened in 1940 to replace Rockford High School, East opened simultaneous to Rockford West to serve the quickly expanding population.

History
By 1935, the attendance in Rockford's single high school grew too large.  The board of education decided it would be best to establish two new high schools on the East and West sides of the Rock River. In 1938, the school board approved $3 million in funding to build two new high schools to replace Rockford High School, with 45% of the budget funded by Works Progress Administration. Rockford High School was renamed as Central High School and the two new schools were opened as East High School and West High School. Rockford West, located on North Rockton Avenue on the Northwest side of the city, remained open for 48 years as a high school, it now serves as West Middle School. Rockford East, located on Charles Street, is still a functioning high school and maintains the traditions of Rockford High School.[7]

Athletics
East takes part in the  Northern Illinois Conference (NIC-10) and is a member of the Illinois High School Association.[4]

Notably, during the 1940s, East's Boys Golf Team placed first in half of the IHSA championships played during the decade, with one additional first place in the late 1950s. 4 of these first place winnings were in a row from the school years 1940-41 to 1944-45 with the 5th being disconnected by placing second in 1945-46, losing by 6 strokes to Hinsdale Central High School.[8]
