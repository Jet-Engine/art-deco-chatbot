Oleson Park Music Pavilion

The Oleson Park Music Pavilion, also known as the Karl King Bandshell, is located in Fort Dodge, Iowa, United States.  The pavilion is associated with Karl King, a famed composer for concert and military bands, who advocated for its construction.[2]  It was designed by Henry L. Kamphoefner, a Sioux City architect at that time, who had previously designed the Grandview Park Music Pavilion in Sioux City.  It was built as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project.  The WPA paid for 85% of its construction, with the City of Fort Dodge paying the rest.  The poured concrete structure was built in a Modernist style with Art Deco overtones.  It rises to a height of 36 feet (11Â m), and it is known for its acoustical excellence.[2]  The pavilion replaced a bandstand that was built in the 1920s in the city square.  It was dedicated to King in 1976, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.[1]
