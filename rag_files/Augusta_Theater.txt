Augusta Theater



The Augusta Theater is a movie palace theater located in the city of Augusta, Kansas, which was built in about 1935. Designed by architect L. P. Larsen, the walls are decorated with large murals depicting classical scenes. It was the first theater to use neon lighting exclusively. Considered to be a landmark of the Art Deco era, it became home of the Augusta Arts Council.

In 1990, the Augusta Arts Council planned to proceed with renovations including restoration of the building's historic facade.[2]

The theater is currently being restored. So far the neon lights on the front of the building have been restored. The murals on the sides of the theater are being restored currently.[citation needed]
