Controversies
2001: Campus arrest and suicide of student Andreas Wickstrom
On December 5, 2001, a school clerk informed a supervisor that he had found a bag of marijuana on campus, in the car of Andreas Wickstrom. The police were notified first, before Andreas's parents, John and Inge Wickstrom. Andreas was arrested and immediately taken to the youth detention facility on Pacific Avenue. Andreas was released in the custody of his mother, who "knew he was in pain" but did not suspect he would harm himself. Three hours after his arrest, Andreas shot himself at home with a shotgun belonging to his grandfather, a retired police officer. Inge recalled, "Andreas kept saying that they treated him like a criminal. There was no protection for him... At least if I had been called to go to the school, I could have reassured him that everything was going to be OK. The very people to whom I had entrusted his care that morning at Poly failed to protect him when he most needed it. If he had a headache or had injured himself, I would have been called immediately."[19]

2005: Graduation ceremony shooting
At 8:40pm on June 15, 2005, a fight began outside of Long Beach Veterans Memorial Stadium, followed by a shooting during the Long Beach Polytechnic High School graduation ceremony. "Authorities believe that someone was injured and driven from the scene because they discovered drops of blood. The victim, however, had not shown up at any area hospital, officials said. Two handguns were found at the scene, but it was unclear if either was the weapon involved. The graduation ceremony was just ending when the shooting occurred. The resulting police investigation caused long delays for people leaving the stadium."[20]
