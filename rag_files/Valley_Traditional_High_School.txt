Valley Traditional High School

Valley became a "traditional" school in 1999 in an attempt to boost enrollment after it had fallen to 63% of capacity.[3]

Currently the enrollment is about 1,000. Valley has been added onto three times plus has had temporary buildings built. Over the years six schools have been built to relieve Valley enrollment and better serve the greater Louisville area.[4]
