Centennial Building

The Centennial Building (also known as the Civic Center) is a historic site in Port St. Joe, Florida. It is located at 300 Allen Memorial Way, across from the Constitution Convention Museum State Park. On March 12, 1996, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.[2]
