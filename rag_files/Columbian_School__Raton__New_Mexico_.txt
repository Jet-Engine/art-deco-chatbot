The Columbian School in Raton, New Mexico, at 700 N. 2nd St., is a Moderne-style school which was built as a Works Progress Administration project in 1939.[2] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.[1]

It was designed by architect Willard C. Kruger.  Additions to the school in 1950 and 1970 do not detract from the historical character.[2]
