Slate Ridge School

Slate Ridge School is a historic school located at Whiteford, Harford County, Maryland. The main block of the building is two stories, constructed of brick with a slate hip roof and a small wooden cupola in the center. It was built in 1912, and designed by the Baltimore architect Otto Simonson. A narrow hyphen containing a stairwell and corridor connects the main block to a similar two-story rectangular block and a one-story wing containing a stage and gymnasium, added just after World War II.  It was used until about 1980.[2]

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.[1]
