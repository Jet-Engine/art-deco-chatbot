Edinburg WPA Auditorium



The Edinburg WPA Auditorium is a historic auditorium building at 67 Main Street in Edinburg, North Dakota.  The Art Deco structure was built in 1938 as part of the Works Progress Administration jobs program.  It is a wood-frame building two stories high, sheathed in boards to which a stucco finish has been applied.  There is a central projecting section on the front facade.  The upper level is a large open space which was usable for a variety of social and recreational activities, and features a well-preserved sprung wooden basketball surface, decorated with the names and logos of area high school basketball teams.  The lower level was originally a utility space.  The upper part of the building was originally accessed via external stairs, but these were removed in 1990, and the building's entrance was reconfigured to have split-level stairs providing access to both upper and lower levels.[2]

The building was used as a local social center through the middle decades of the 20th century, with rollerskating being a popular pastime, and is now occupied by a hardware store.[2]  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.[1]
