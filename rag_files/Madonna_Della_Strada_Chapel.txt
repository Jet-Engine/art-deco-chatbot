Madonna Della Strada Chapel

Madonna della Strada is a chapel on the campus of Loyola University Chicago in the neighborhood of Rogers Park, Chicago: it is named after a painting of the Virgin Mary, known as Madonna Della Strada, enshrined at the Church of the Gesù in Rome, the mother church of the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits).

History
The Chapel was the dream of Father James Mertz, S.J., who raised the money for its construction. The Madonna Della Strada Chapel is the main chapel on the Lake Shore Campus of Loyola University Chicago. The chapel was built on the lakefront with the waters of Lake Michigan directly at its front doorstep.  The church was designed and built at a time when it was anticipated that Lake Shore Drive would be extended and pass directly in front, but that project was abandoned.[1] The chapel was designed by architect Andrew Rebori in the Art Deco Style and opened its doors to the Loyola University Chicago Community in 1938.[2] Because of scant record keeping, it is not certain which of the several artists and designers were responsible for each of the artworks and decorations at the Chapel, but Chicago's Edgar Miller did figure prominently in the process and execution of many of the works.

Several chapel churches in Latin America were named after the chapel church in Chicago, as a tribute to Loyola University Chicago Jesuit and student missionaries.

Stained glass windows
The seven stained glass windows on the north side of the nave represents the seven colleges that existed when the Chapel was built.

The seven stained glass windows on the south side of the nave illustrate the principal ministries of the Jesuits.

Renovations
Renovation of Madonna della Strada began in July 2006 and concluded in August 2007.[2] A cooling system and mechanical ventilation system were installed.[3]

Katheryn "Kay" Stamm Memorial Organ
A new pipe organ by Goulding and Wood was built and installed in 2008. The Katheryn "Kay" Stamm Memorial Organ has 70 ranks distributed over three manuals and pedal and played via a terraced console located in the rear gallery.[4]

The chapel hosts an annual "Midnight Organ Blast" at midnight on Halloween, featuring eerie melodies.[5]

The Loyola University Department of Sacramental Life hosts a series of free organ concerts on the third Sunday of each month.[6]
