Berkeley Public Library

The Berkeley Public Library is the public library system for Berkeley, California. It consists of the Central Library, Claremont Branch, North Branch, West Branch, Tarea Hill Pittman South Branch, and the Tool Lending Library, which is one of the nation's first such libraries.

History
The Berkeley Public Library opened in 1893 on Shattuck Avenue with 264 books.  In 1905, the library moved to a new brick building on Shattuck Avenue at 2090 Kittredge Street. The new library was funded by Andrew Carnegie and  built on land donated by Rosa M. Shattuck, the widow of Francis K. Shattuck.  Immediately following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the resulting population surge from across the San Francisco Bay, the library opened four other branches around Berkeley.  In 1930, the library was demolished and a new design from architect James W. Plachek was approved.[3] Construction of the new building began in 1931.[4] The new central library opened in 1934, where it remains.[5] It was renovated and reopened in 2002.[6]

In 2011, the Berkeley Public Library began a series of renovations and expansions of its four neighborhood branches. It completed renovation of the Claremont and North Branches in 2012, the South Branch and Tool Lending Library in May 2013, and the West Branch library in December 2013.[7] During construction, a bookmobile called the Branch Van parked near each location to conduct basic transactions and provide access to library collections in the local neighborhoods.[citation needed]

On July 1, 2018, the Berkeley Public Library eliminated overdue fines for non-children's media; children's books were already fine-free.[8] The Tool Lending Library followed suit on October 3, 2022.[9]

Also in 2018, Berkeley Public Library instituted the Easy Access Card, a library card available to persons without a fixed address.[10]

Technology
All Berkeley Public Library branches have self-checkout machines. Patrons can use these to check out materials themselves by scanning the items and their library card. This checkout method works for all media—books, CDs, DVDs, etc.—and provides the patron with a receipt for the items. All branches still also offer checkout from library staff at circulation desks.[citation needed]

Patrons can also request and renew books over the Internet from their homes, or over the telephone.[11]

Tool Lending Library
The Tool Lending Library opened in 1979 and is one of the nation's first such libraries.[6][12] It is located at the South Branch. To borrow tools, patrons must be over the age of 18 and be residents or property owners of the city of Berkeley.[13]

Tool Lending Library offerings include basic hand tools, light power tools, and equipment: screwdrivers, various hammers, drills, biscuit jointers, string trimmers ("weed wackers") shovels, ladders, concrete mixers—and free advice. Lending times are seven days for manual items, and two days for power tools.

Significance
The primary Berkeley Public Library stands as the architectural creation of James W. Plachek (c.1885-1948), a locally renowned and versatile architect who played a pivotal role in shaping downtown Berkeley and its civic center between the two World Wars. A prominent example of Zig Zag Moderne, the library showcases the style's distinctive features, including modern materials, construction efficiency, and artistic excellence. Its significance extends beyond architectural merit, encompassing its harmonious integration with stylistically similar structures, exceptional state of preservation, and the groundbreaking 1973 restoration.

Constructed during the Great Depression, the library's realization was made possible through community support, drawing widespread attention and reflecting Berkeley's longstanding tradition of backing libraries. This tradition dates back to the Shattuck family donations of 1893 and 1903 and culminated in the overwhelming voter approval of a special post-Prop.13 library tax in 1980.

Berkeley's initial public library building, funded by a Carnegie grant in 1903, was designed by John Galen Howard, the Beaux Arts architect of the University of California. The library's expansion requests in 1913 and the subsequent voter-approved library building tax in 1921 and 1925 foreshadowed its need for growth. Despite the challenges posed by the Depression, Berkeley remained committed to the construction of a new library. In 1930, work commenced with the demolition of the 25-year-old Howard building, perceived as too small and stylistically outdated by progressive Berkeleyans.

James Plachek, a local civic and professional leader, emerged as the chosen architect for the project. His extensive involvement in Berkeley's civic affairs, coupled with his experience as an architect, made him a natural fit for the role. Plachek had previously designed branch libraries, including Tudor Revival and Spanish Colonial styles, as well as various city buildings such as schools, firehouses, and police stations. Notably, he was one of the few architects of his time to transition from period revival designs to the modern style.

The library's opening in 1931 garnered attention, with a 10-page lead article in the January 1931 Architect & Engineer praising its responsiveness to community needs, modernity, meaningful artistry, and structural simplicity. Plachek's comprehensive approach extended to the design of light fixtures, furniture, and hardware, all locally constructed.

Beyond its architectural significance, the library played a key role in the development of downtown Berkeley. In 1932, two adjacent structures, the U.A. Theater and a tiled store building were added, enhancing its integration into the Main Street setting. Today, the library anchors a de facto civic center, aligned with other prominent structures such as the post office, municipal offices, Veterans' Memorial, City Hall, and Plachek's police station, creating a cohesive urban ensemble.[14]
