Tower Petroleum Building

The Tower Petroleum Building (also known as The Tower Building) is a historic Art Deco Skyscraper located at 1907 Elm Street in the City Center District of Downtown Dallas. The tower, a contributing property in the Dallas Downtown Historic District and the Harwood Street Historic District, features Zig-zag Moderne styling and was designed by architect Mark Lemmon.

Design
The Tower Petroleum Building features Zig-zag Moderne motifs, one of the few buildings left in Downtown Dallas which features such designs.  The building's facade is clad in limestone and has green spandrels panels between the windows.[3] The upper floors of the building are set back twice from the shaft of the building starting with a three-story set back from the 19th floor.  At the 22nd floor, the top sets back again and this section is 2 stories in height.  These setbacks occur on three sides of the building.[3]

History
Adaptive reuse
In June 2007, the Dallas City Council approved a $15 million plan by a local developer to renovate and convert the Tower Petroleum Building into a luxury high-rise hotel.[5]
In 2018, Developer John Kirtland completed a 52 million dollar substantial renovation of the tower Petroleum. The Saint Elm Hotel (Marriott) is a 177 Key Hotel operating in the Petroleum Tower.
