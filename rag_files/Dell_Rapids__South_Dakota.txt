Dell Rapids, South Dakota



Dell Rapids is a city in Minnehaha County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 3,996 at the 2020 census.[7] It is known as "The Little City with the Big Attractions."

The city took its name from the Dells of the Wisconsin River, which were likened to the local rapids on the Big Sioux River.[8]

History
Dell Rapids was originally named Dell City, but was renamed after the rapids of the Big Sioux River.[8] After a fire broke out on the main street and burned most of the town, it was rebuilt out of Sioux Quartzite,[8] a common rock in the area. The Chicago, Milwaukee, and Saint Paul Railroad built a railroad into the area, reaching Dell Rapids from Egan in 1881. Two large Sioux Quartzite quarries owned by LG Everist are operated via this rail line, which is now operated by LG's subsidiary, the D&I Railroad. The community celebrates its heritage with the annual "Quarry Days" in July, and in June, the city hosts "Cootie Days", where rides and games are set up and available in the city's park.
