The 154-foot (47Â m) tall building is the highest in the city. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 19, 2018, for its significance in architecture.

History and description
In 1930, People's Bank and Trust Company acquired three other banking institutions, the Hobart Trust Company, the City
Trust Company and the Merchants Bank of Passaic, and needed a new, larger building. The building was designed with Art Deco style by the architectural firm of Halsey, McCormack and Helmer based in New York City. They had previously designed the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower. The building was constructed by John W. Ferguson Company of Paterson. The first floor features storefronts, followed by an ashlar limestone section with large windows, and finally a yellow buff brick office tower. Originally 11-stories, a third floor mezzanine was added in 2016.[4]
