Wickenburg High School



Wickenburg High School is a high school in Wickenburg, Arizona under the jurisdiction of the Wickenburg Unified School District. It is double-listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Arizona. The original Colonial Revival high school and annex were completed in 1925 and 1935, respectively. In 1934, the Works Progress Administration-built gymnasium was completed in a Moderne style. It is the town's only WPA building and the larger of two cast-in-place concrete structures in the town; it also is separately listed. The two buildings were put on the NRHP at the same time (July 1986). In 1999, the high school moved to a new building.[3]
