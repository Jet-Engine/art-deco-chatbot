ABC Commissary

The ABC Commissary is a restaurant on Commissary Lane at Disney's Hollywood Studios, one of the four main theme parks at Walt Disney World.[1] The restaurant has an Art Deco design.[2] It is more popular than the other counter service restaurants in the park,[3] and offers a larger variety of menu options.[4] The ABC Commissary's menu is themed to programs broadcast by American Broadcasting Company (ABC), including such items as Down the Hatch (fried fish), a reference to the hatch in the television series Lost.[5] The restaurant also offers a fried prawn burger.[6] The deep-fried foods on the menu do not contain trans fat.[7] In 2013, the ABC Commissary was one of several restaurants in the park to offer apple pie cupcakes in celebration of Independence Day.[8] The ABC Commissary is located next to the Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater Restaurant.[9] In The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World with Kids 2012, Bob Sehlinger and Liliane Opsomer write that the ABC Commissary is "hard to find" but "usually not too crowded".[10]
