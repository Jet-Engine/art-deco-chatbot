La Plata station

La Plata station is an Amtrak train station in La Plata, Missouri, United States and is a passenger stop for Amtrak's Southwest Chief long-distance route between Chicago and Los Angeles. It was built in 1945 by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway as a replacement for an 1887-built, 1888-opened passenger and freight depot that was in deteriorating condition. Efforts to replace the station were stalled by a lack of construction material during World War II. The 1945 replacement was built in Art Deco style, and was restored between 1996 and 2001 by local preservationists, a model railroad club, and a garden club. The station was upgraded again in 2022 with upgrades done to the station building and the platform to bring it into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.[4] It also hosts 2 Virtual Railfan cameras.[5]
