Maxie Theatre



The Maxie Theatre was a historic movie theatre at 136 Arkansas Highway 463 South in Trumann, Arkansas.  It is a single-screen theatre, housed in a large Art Deco structure built in 1948-9 by Zell Jaynes.  At the time of its opening it featured the latest in amenities, including air conditioning, upholstered seats, and a fancy curtain to cover the screen.  It also had a purpose-built segregated seating area for African-American in the balcony, with separate entrance, ticketing, and concession facilities.  Until its closure in 2012 the theatre was one of oldest continuously-operating businesses in Trumann and was the town's only theatre.[2]

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011,[1] and was delisted in 2020.[3]
