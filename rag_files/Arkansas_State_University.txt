Arkansas State University (A-State[6] or ASU) is a public research university in Jonesboro, Arkansas.  It is the flagship campus of the Arkansas State University System and the second largest university in the state. The university was founded in 1909 and is located atop 1,376 acres (557 hectares) on Crowley's Ridge.[citation needed]

Arkansas State University is classified among "R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity".[7]

History
A-State was founded as the First District Agricultural School in Jonesboro in 1909 by the Arkansas Legislature as a regional agricultural training school. Robert W. Glover, a Missionary Baptist pastor who served in both houses of the Arkansas Legislature from Sheridan (1905–1912), introduced in 1909 the resolution calling for the establishment of four state agricultural colleges, including the future ASU.[8]

In 1918, ASU began offering a two-year college program. In 1925, it became First District Agricultural and Mechanical College. A four-year degree program was begun in 1930. A & M College became Arkansas State College in 1933. In 1967, the Arkansas Legislature elevated the college to university status and changed the name to Arkansas State University.

In the fall of 2014, A-State welcomed its most academically prepared freshman class.  The result of several years of growing both admission standards and increasing on-campus housing, A-State's incoming first-year first-time student composite ACT was 23.9 with an average high school GPA of 3.47 (Current freshman ACTs are 20-26 and the average high school GPA is 3.7[9]).  This was the third consecutive year of improvement for the ACT/GPA freshman classes for Arkansas State. The Arkansas State Honors College has grown 59% since 2009. The university also posted back-to-back high graduate counts in spring 2012 and spring 2013, producing the most graduates in a two-year period in school history.[citation needed] The university contains the largest library in the state of Arkansas, the Dean B. Ellis Library.[citation needed]
