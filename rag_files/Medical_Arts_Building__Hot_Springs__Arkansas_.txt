Medical Arts Building (Hot Springs, Arkansas)

The Medical Arts Building is a historic skyscraper at 236 Central Avenue in downtown Hot Springs, Arkansas.  It is a 16-story structure with Art Deco styling, rising to a height of 180 feet (55Â m).  It was built in 1929 to a design by Almand & Stuck, and is the first skyscraper and was the tallest building in the state until 1960. 

Its main entrance is framed by fluted pilasters, topped by floral panels and a stone frieze identifying the building.[2]

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.[1]  Today, all but the first floor is in disrepair and closed to the public. In May 2021 the first 15 floors of the building were purchased and are currently under renovation.[3]
