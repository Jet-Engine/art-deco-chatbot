Fountain County Courthouse

Fountain County Courthouse is a historic courthouse located at Covington, Fountain County, Indiana. It was built in 1937 as a Public Works Administration project.[2]

History
Fountain County Courthouse was designed by Louis Johnson, and completed in July 1937. The construction of the building cost $228,822.  It is a three-story, Art Deco style, flat roofed building faced with Indiana limestone.  It measures 116 feet by 89 feet and incorporates a 32 foot-square wired-glass skylight.[3]: 5  It was built to replace three previous courthouses that were built in 1827, 1833, and 1859.[4]

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.[1]

Interior
The interior features a collection of murals, totaling 2,500 square foot, painted by Eugene Savage. The murals reflect the history of Fountain County.[4] In 1983, the murals underwent conservation, using sealant which caused the paint to begin to peel from the walls.[5]
