Dawes County Courthouse



The Dawes County Courthouse in Chadron, Nebraska, United States, was built in 1935.  It was designed in Art Deco style by John W. Latenser & Sons, Inc.  It is the courthouse of Dawes County, Nebraska.

Located on S. Main St. between 4th and 5th Sts. in Chadron, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995;  the listing included the courthouse building and two contributing objects.[1][2][3]
It is located at the end of the courthouse square it overlooks, because it was built as a replacement for an older, centered courthouse that remained in use during construction, and which only later was removed.
