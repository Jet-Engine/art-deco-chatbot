The Cadillac Hotel & Beach Club is a historic U.S. hotel in Miami Beach, Florida. It is located at 3925 Collins Avenue. On October 5, 2005, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).[1]

It was designed by architect Roy France. A 1956 addition was designed by Melvin Grossman.[2] It is also a contributing building in the NRHP-listed Collins Waterfront Architectural District.

It has been used as a hotel except for three years from 1942 to 1945 when it was leased by the United States military.[2]

It is built of concrete block with a stucco finish, atop a wood piling and concrete slab foundation.[2]

The hotel was part of Courtyard by Marriott for a number of years and was named Courtyard Cadillac Miami Beach/Oceanfront. It closed in September 2017 for major renovations by its owners, Hersha Hospitality Trust and reopened in August 2018[3] as an Autograph Collection by Marriott hotel, with 357 guest rooms, two pools, meeting spaces, a bar and restaurants.
