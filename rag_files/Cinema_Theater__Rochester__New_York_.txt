Cinema Theater (Rochester, New York)

The Cinema Theater is a motion picture theater in Rochester, New York. Opened as a neighborhood motion picture theater in 1914, it is one of the oldest continuously operated motion picture theaters in the United States.[1] The theater is located at the corner of South Clinton Avenue and South Goodman Street in Rochester.

History
Originally named "The Clinton", due to a circular arrangement of wooden benches with an open area in the middle, it was affectionately referred to as the "flea pit", a name which stuck for many years — and long after the original dirt floor was covered and the benches were replaced with seats.[1] In 1949 it was renamed the Cinema by its owners, Morris Slotknick and Philip Cohen, and four years later it was enlarged to extend a full city block, and its distinctive Art Deco facade installed.[2] The business was acquired by Jo Ann Morreale in 1985.[1]

In April 2006, The Cinema was about to close due to financial difficulties, but long-time patron and real-estate developer John Trickey stepped in and financially brought the cinema back. This was celebrated with a ceremony of "Relighting the Marque". Trickey formally took over as the sole owner of the theater in 2012. In 2018, the business was leased to a local couple while Trickey retains ownership of the building.[3]

Current status
The Cinema has one screen and films tend to rotate weekly. They show a mixture of mainstream and independent films. The schedule usually features an afternoon matinee on weekends and daily double features in the evening.[1] The theater is also known for having resident pet cats that moviegoers can socialize with.[3]
