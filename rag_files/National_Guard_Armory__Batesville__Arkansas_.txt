National Guard Armory (Batesville, Arkansas)

The former National Guard Armory of Batesville, Arkansas, is located at 380 South Ninth Street.  Built in 1936, it is a large and imposing sandstone structure with Gothic Revival and Art Deco features.

It was designed by Peter Blaauw, a Dutch architect from Sulphur Rock, and built with funding from the Works Progress Administration.  After the National Guard vacated the facility in 1976, it was used for storage and sat vacant until about 1998, when it was adapted for use by the Old Independence Regional Museum.[2]

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.[1]
