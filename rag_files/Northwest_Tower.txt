Northwest Tower

The Northwest Tower, popularly known as the Coyote Building,[1] is a 12-story Art Deco building at the corner of North Avenue and Milwaukee Avenue in Chicago. It was designed by Perkins, Chatten & Hammond and built between 1928 and 1929.[2][3]

Overview
The Northwest Tower is one of the first skyscrapers in Chicago to have been constructed outside the downtown area.[4] The tower was built on the site of the Noel State Bank, near the Damen stop on the Chicago "L". It was originally marketed to attorneys, doctors, and other professionals.[4] In the 1980s, it became home to the Tower Coyote Gallery, reportedly named because artists thought the building resembled a howling coyote. Over the next two decades, the surrounding neighborhood held an annual arts festival called Around the Coyote.[5] In 2008, the Chicago Zoning Board approved plans to convert the building into a hotel, but financial difficulties prevented the building's owner from moving ahead with the project.[6]

Hotel
In 2012, the property was purchased by a venture backed by Don Wilson and AJ Capita with the intent to renovate the property into a boutique hotel. Hotel Robey, named after the prior name for Damen Avenue, offers 69 rooms and Cafe Robey serving French-American cuisine. The hotel is operated by Grupo Habita, a Mexico-based hotel group with 14 hotels in Mexico and one in New York.[7]

Renovation
From 2015 to 2017, Northwest Tower was renovated by the Chicago-based Antunovich Associates as the architect of record, design work by Brussels offices of Nicolas Schuybroek Architects, and interior work by Marc Merckx Interiors.[8]
