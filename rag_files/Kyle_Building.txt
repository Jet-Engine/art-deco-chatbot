Kyle Building



The Kyle Building (also known as Kyle Block) was built in 1933 in downtown Beaumont, Texas. It was designed as a retail storefront, with two-story offices at each end of the building. It is located at 215 Orleans St.  The building contains 11 stores, and it is an excellent example of Zig-Zag Art Deco architecture.[2] A contributing property to the Beaumont Historic District, it is located at the site of the former Kyle Opera house, which was demolished in 1931.[3][4]
