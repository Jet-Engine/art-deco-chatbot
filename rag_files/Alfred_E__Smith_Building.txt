Alfred E. Smith Building

The Alfred E. Smith  Building, known officially as the Alfred E. Smith State Office Building and sometimes called simply the Smith Building, is a structure located in downtown Albany, New York across the street from the New York State Capitol and One Commerce Plaza. The building's namesake, Alfred Emmanuel Smith, was a four-term governor of New York and the Democratic Party's nomination for the 1928 presidential election. The Art Deco skyscraper has 34 stories and is Albany's second tallest structure (after the Erastus Corning Tower) at 388 feet (118 m). Completed in 1928, it houses offices of the New York State government. It was built originally with an open-air observation deck on the 31st floor, 350 feet (110 m) above the ground; this deck was closed in 1976 when the enclosed Corning Tower Observation Deck on the 42nd floor, 589 feet (180 m) up, was opened.[1] An extensive renovation of the building began in 2002. This modernization, which cost at least $103 million, is now finished.

Prior to reconstruction, the building was home to the state Comptroller's Office.  With the renovation complete, the new tenants include the New York State Department of Civil Service, Department of State, New York State Banking Department, New York State Liquor Authority, and Division of the Budget.

The Alfred E. Smith Building has several distinctive features. These include the engraving of the names of all 62 New York State counties around the street-level facade and an Art Deco lobby with a mural depicting famous New Yorkers. A tunnel connects the building to the Capitol. The skyscraper is constructed of limestone and granite, and has views of Albany and the nearby landscape.
