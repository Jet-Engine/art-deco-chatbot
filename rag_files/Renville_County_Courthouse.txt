Renville County Courthouse



The Renville County Courthouse in Mohall, North Dakota was built from 1936 to 1937 and dedicated in June 1937.[2]  The building was designed in the Moderne style by architect E. W. Molander.  The construction was partially funded by the Works Progress Administration and overseen by general contractor Iver Orheim.[3]  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.[1]

The front facade is made of brick with Kettle River sandstone on the parapet.  The name "Memorial Court House" is engraved in a frieze above the front entrance.[4]  Of nine county courthouses built in North Dakota during 1929â€“1940, it is the one having Moderne rather than Art Deco styling.[4][5]
