Architecture
Art Deco style emphasizes geometric forms: spheres, polygons, rectangles, trapezoids, zigzags, chevrons, and sunburst motifs. Elements are often arranged in symmetrical patterns. Modern materials such as aluminum, stainless steel, Bakelite, chrome, and plastics are used. Colors tend to be vivid and high-contrast.[3][4][5][6][7]
