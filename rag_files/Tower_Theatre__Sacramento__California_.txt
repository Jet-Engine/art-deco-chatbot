Tower Theatre (Sacramento, California)

The Tower Theatre, built in 1938, is a Sacramento, California landmark[1] and the oldest remaining, continuously running picture palace.[2][3]

The theater was designed by California theater architect William B. David in the Streamline Moderne style of architecture.[4][5]  The original owner was Joseph Blumenfeld, a second generation theatre owner. At the time, there was only one movie screen.  The first movie shown was Algiers.  The theatre was renovated in 1972 and divided into a three screen cinema.[6]

They were bought by the Reading International theater chain in 1998, who, upgraded the theater in 2012 with digital projectors. In 2016, it was sold to an endowment fund as a long-term investment.[7]

The theater has showcased the premieres of Colin Hanks’ All Things Must Pass and Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird.[8] Both Hanks and Gerwig are Sacramento natives.
