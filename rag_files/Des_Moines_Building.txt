Des Moines Building

The Des Moines Building is a historic building located in downtown Des Moines, Iowa, United States built in 1930 and based on the designs of the Des Moines architectural firm of Proudfoot, Rawson, Souers & Thomas.  It is a combination of the Art deco and Art Moderne styles.  The 14-story structure rises to a height of 190 feet (58Â m).[2]  The former office building was abandoned and in May 2011 the city of Des Moines declared it a public nuisance so as to acquire it to be redeveloped.  In November of the same year they sold the building for $150,000 to Des Moines Apartments, LP who developed it into 146 loft apartments.[3][4]  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.[1] The basement is home to a recreational room as well as a workout room. The rooftop is accessible via the 14th floor and has a great 360 degree view of Des Moines. The building is also connected to the city's extensive skywalk system.
