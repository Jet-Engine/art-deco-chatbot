Old Wayne County High School



The Wayne County High School, at 80 A.J. Lloyd Cir. in Monticello, Kentucky, was built in 1941.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.[1]

It has also been known as A.J. Lloyd Middle School.[2]

It is Art Deco in style.[1]  It was built during 1939â€“41 with funding from the Works Progress Administration.  It was deemed to have "played a significant role in education in the community" and to have "reshaped the delivery of public education in the county".  The school replaced four separate high schools. "'The educational advantages given by a consolidated high school provided students with an ability to conceive of life away from Wayne County and an education upon which to begin that journey.'"[2]
